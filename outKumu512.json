This leads to the definition of unrestricted input zero-knowledge proofs of knowledge in which the prover demonstrates possession of knowledge without revealing any computational information whatsoever (not even the one bit revealed in zero-knowledge proofs of assertions). We show the relevance of these notions to identification schemes, in which parties prove their identity by demonstrating their knowledge rather than by proving the validity of assertions. We describe a novel scheme which is provably secure if factoring is difficult and whose practical implementations are about two orders of magnitude faster than RSA-based identification schemes. The advantages of thinking in terms of proofs of knowledge rather than proofs of assertions are demonstrated in two efficient variants of the scheme: unrestricted input zero-knowledge proofs of knowledge are used in the construction of a scheme which needs no directory; a version of the scheme based on parallel interactive proofs (which are not known to be zero knowledge) is proved secure by observing that the identification protocols are proofs of knowledge.",

In this paper, we address a question on the cost of secure and authenticated message delivery/storage, namely, whether it is possible to transport/store messages of varying length in a secure and authenticated way with an expense less than that required by “signature followed by encryption”. This question seems to have never been addressed in the literature since the invention of public key cryptography. We then present a positive answer to the question. In particular, we discover a new cryptographic primitive termed as “signcryption” which simultaneously fulfills both the functions of digital signature and public key encryption in a logically single step, and with a cost significantly lower than that required by “signature followed by encryption”. For typical security parameters for high level security applications (size of public moduli = 1536 bits), signcryption costs 50% (31%, respectively) less in computation time and 85% (91%, respectively) less in message expansion than does “signature followed by encryption” based on the discrete logarithm problem (factorization problem, respectively).",

We prove the new test to be of a very small emorprobability (in particular, much smaller than constant). The new test enables us to prove a low-error characterization of NP in terms of PCP. Specifically, OUT theorem states that, for any given c > 0, membership in any NP language can be verijied with 0(1) accesses, each r’eading logarithmic number of bits, and such that the error-probability is 2‘“~’-’ n. Our results are in fact stronger, as stated below. One application of the new characterization of NP is that approximating SETCOVER to within a logarithmic factors is NP-hard. Previous analysis for low-degree-tests, as well as previous characten”zations of NP in terms of PCP, have managed to achieve, with constant number of accesses, error-probability of, at best, a constant. The proof for the smail err-or-probability of our new low-degree-test is, nevertheless, significantly simpler than previous proofs.

Since the early days, when the classes P and NP were defined, and the question was posed as to whether they are the same or do they differ, many problems were shown to be NP-complete, thereby increasing the weight on finding stricter characterization for the class NP. NP has since been given a few alternative characterizations. The one most commonly applied being Cook’s [CO071], which characterizes NP in terms of efficient verification of proofs (or nondeterministic computations). A new perspective, by which improved characterizations of NP can be obtained, has been recently proposed. The motivation for which stems from questions regarding the hardness of approximation versions, for problems whose exact computation is known to be NP-hard. This avenue of research was initiated by [FGL+91], which introduced a new methodology for proving hardness results for approximation problems. The method takes advantage of results in a seemingly unrelated area — that of interactive proofs [GMR89, Bab85, BGKW88, LFKN92, Sha92, BFL91] — however interprets those results with quite a different perspective in mind. Much effort has been invested since towards a better understanding of this methodology, and the class NP has consequently gained stricter characterizations [AS92, ALM+92, BGS95], which are referred to as characterizations of NP in terms of PCP (or, in short, PCP characterizations of NP). The PCP characterization of NP — though has taken around 20 years to be formulated — seems now as the most natural extension of the old characterization of NP [CO071], if one has in mind proving hardness results for approximation problems. This characterization has already been used to obtain quite a few hardness results for approximation problems [FGL+91, AS92, ALM+ 92, PY91, LY94, BGLR93, KLS93, BGS95, Hiis96a, H5a96b, H5s97]. The previous characterization of NP in terms of the PCP hierarchy [AS92, ALM+ 92], seemed at first ss the best possible up to constant factors. A stronger characterization was later conjectured in [BGLR93]; one that, as an outcome, implies NP-hardness of approximating SET-COVER to within logarithmic factors [LY94, BGLR93].

We give a definition of protocol divertibility that applies to arbitrary 2-party protocols and is compatible with Okamoto and Ohta's definition in the case of interactive zero-knowledge proofs. Other important examples falling under the new definition are blind signature protocols. We propose a sufficiency criterion for divertibility that is satisfied by many existing protocols and which, surprisingly, generalizes to cover several protocols not normally associated with divertibility (e.g., Diffie-Hellman key exchange). Next, we introduce atomic proxy cryptography, in which an atomic proxy function, in conjunction with a public proxy key, converts ciphertexts (messages or signatures) for one key into ciphertexts for another. Proxy keys, once generated, may be made public and proxy functions applied in untrusted environments. We present atomic proxy functions for discrete-log-based encryption, identification, and signature schemes. It is not clear whether atomic proxy functions exist in general for all public-key cryptosystems. Finally, we discuss the relationship between divertibility and proxy cryptography.",

We show that, with respect to these definitions, security is preserved under a natural composition operation. The definitions follow the general paradigm of known definitions; yet some substantial modifications and simplifications are introduced. The composition operation is the natural ``subroutine substitution'' operation, formalized by Micali and Rogaway. We consider several standard settings for multiparty protocols, including the cases of eavesdropping, Byzantine, nonadaptive and adaptive adversaries, as well as the information-theoretic and the computational models. In particular, in the computational model we provide the first definition of security of protocols that is shown to be preserved under composition.",

      "abstract": "We propose a novel paradigm for defining security of cryptographic protocols, called universally composable security. The salient property of universally composable definitions of security is that they guarantee security even when a secure protocol is composed of an arbitrary set of protocols, or more generally when the protocol is used as a component of an arbitrary system. This is an essential property for maintaining security of cryptographic protocols in complex and unpredictable environments such as the Internet. In particular, universally composable definitions guarantee security even when an unbounded number of protocol instances are executed concurrently in an adversarially controlled manner, they guarantee non-malleability with respect to arbitrary protocols, and more. We show how to formulate universally composable definitions of security for practically any cryptographic task. Furthermore, we demonstrate that practically any such definition can be realized using known techniques, as long as only a minority of the participants are corrupted. We then proceed to formulate universally composable definitions of a wide array of cryptographic tasks, including authenticated and secure communication, key-exchange, public-key encryption, signature, commitment, oblivious transfer, zero knowledge and more. We also make initial steps towards studying the realizability of the proposed definitions in various settings.",

      "abstract": "In this paper we introduce the concept of privacy preserving data mining. In our model, two parties owning confidential databases wish to run a data mining algorithm on the union of their databases, without revealing any unnecessary information. This problem has many practical and important applications, such as in medical research with confidential patient records. \n \nData mining algorithms are usually complex, especially as the size of the input is measured in megabytes, if not gigabytes. A generic secure multi-party computation solution, based on evaluation of a circuit computing the algorithm on the entire input, is therefore of no practical use. We focus on the problem of decision tree learning and use ID3, a popular and widely used algorithm for this problem. We present a solution that is considerably more efficient than generic solutions. It demands very few rounds of communication and reasonable bandwidth. In our solution, each party performs by itself a computation of the same order as computing the ID3 algorithm for its own database. The results are then combined using efficient cryptographic protocols, whose overhead is only logarithmic in the number of transactions in the databases. We feel that our result is a substantial contribution, demonstrating that secure multi-party computation can be made practical, even for complex problems and large inputs.",

      "abstract": "One of the main challenges of securing multicast communicationis source authentication,or enabling receivers of multicast data to verify that the received data originated with the claimed source and was not modified enroute. The problem becomes more complex in common settings where other receivers of the data are not trusted, and where lost packets are not retransmitted. Several source authentication schemes for multicast have been suggested in the past, but none of these schemes is satisfactorily efficient in all prominent parameters. We recently proposed a very efficient scheme, TESLA, that is based on initial loose time synchronization between the sender and the receivers, followed by delayed release of keys by the sender. This paper proposes several substantial modifications and improvements to TESLA. One modification allows receivers to authenticate most packets as soon as they arrive (whereas TESLArequires buffering packets at the receiver side, and provides delayed authentication only). Other modifications improve the scalability of the scheme, reduce the space overhead for multiple instances, increase its resistance to denial-of-service attacks, and more.",

      "abstract": "A credential system is a system in which users can obtain credentials from organizations and demonstrate possession of these credentials. Such a system is anonymous when transactions carried out by the same user cannot be linked. An anonymous credential system is of significant practical relevance because it is the best means of providing privacy for users. In this paper we propose a practical anonymous credential system that is based on the strong RSA assumption and the decisional Diffie-Hellman assumption modulo a safe prime product and is considerably superior to existing ones: (1) We give the first practical solution that allows a user to unlinkably demonstrate possession of a credential as many times as necessary without involving the issuing organization. (2) To prevent misuse of anonymity, our scheme is the first to offer optional anonymity revocation for particular transactions. (3) Our scheme offers separability: all organizations can choose their cryptographic keys independently of each other. Moreover, we suggest more effective means of preventing users from sharing their credentials, by introducing all-or-nothing sharing: a user who allows a friend to use one of her credentials once, gives him the ability to use all of her credentials, i.e., taking over her identity. This is implemented by a new primitive, called circular encryption, which is of independent interest, and can be realized from any semantically secure cryptosystem in the random oracle model.",

The embedding process creates a stego medium by replacing these redundant bits with data from the hidden message.

An email gateway wants to test whether the email contains the keyword “urgent” so that it could route the email accordingly.

We define and construct a mechanism that enables Alice to provide a key to the gateway that enables the gateway to test whether the word “urgent” is a keyword in the email without learning anything else about the email. We refer to this mechanism as Public Key Encryption with keyword Search. As another example, consider a mail server that stores various messages publicly encrypted for Alice by others. Using our mechanism Alice can send the mail server a key that will enable the server to identify all messages containing some specific keyword, but learn nothing else. We define the concept of public key encryption with keyword search and give several constructions.",

In an effort to mitigate the damage caused by exposure of secret data (e.g., keys) stored on such devices, the paradigm of forward security was introduced. In a forward-secure scheme, secret keys are updated at regular periods of time; furthermore, exposure of a secret key corresponding to a given time period does not enable an adversary to \"break\" the scheme (in the appropriate sense) for any prior time period. A number of constructions of forward-secure digital signature schemes, key-exchange protocols, and symmetric-key schemes are known. \n \nWe present the first constructions of a (non-interactive) forward-secure public-key encryption scheme. Our main construction achieves security against chosen plaintext attacks under the decisional bilinear Diffie-Hellman assumption in the standard model. It is practical, and all complexity parameters grow at most logarithmically with the total number of time periods. The scheme can also be extended to achieve security against chosen ciphertext attacks.",

Moreover, DAA allows for pseudonyms, i.e., for each signature a user (in agreement with the recipient of the signature) can decide whether or not the signature should be linkable to another signature. DAA furthermore allows for detection of \"known\" keys: if the DAA secret keys are extracted from a TPM and published, a verifier can detect that a signature was produced using these secret keys.

      "abstract": "We study the problem of maximizing the expected spread of an innovation or behavior within a social network, in the presence of “word-of-mouth” referral. Our work builds on the observation that individuals’ decisions to purchase a product or adopt an innovation are strongly influenced by recommendations from their friends and acquaintances. Understanding and leveraging this influence may thus lead to a much larger spread of the innovation than the traditional view of marketing to individuals in isolation. \n \nIn this paper, we define a natural and general model of influence propagation that we term the decreasing cascade model, generalizing models used in the sociology and economics communities. In this model, as in related ones, a behavior spreads in a cascading fashion according to a probabilistic rule, beginning with a set of initially “active” nodes. We study the target set selection problem: we wish to choose a set of individuals to target for initial activation, such that the cascade beginning with this active set is as large as possible in expectation. We show that in the decreasing cascade model, a natural greedy algorithm is a 1-1/ e-e approximation for selecting a target set of size k.",

One drawback of encrypting data, is that it can be selectively shared only at a coarse-grained level (i.e., giving another party your private key). We develop a new cryptosystem for fine-grained sharing of encrypted data that we call Key-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (KP-ABE). In our cryptosystem, ciphertexts are labeled with sets of attributes and private keys are associated with access structures that control which ciphertexts a user is able to decrypt. We demonstrate the applicability of our construction to sharing of audit-log information and broadcast encryption. Our construction supports delegation of private keys which subsumesHierarchical Identity-Based Encryption (HIBE).",

      "abstract": "In this work we provide efficient distributed protocols for generating shares of random noise, secure against malicious participants. The purpose of the noise generation is to create a distributed implementation of the privacy-preserving statistical databases described in recent papers [14,4,13]. In these databases, privacy is obtained by perturbing the true answer to a database query by the addition of a small amount of Gaussian or exponentially distributed random noise. The computational power of even a simple form of these databases, when the query is just of the form ∑if(di), that is, the sum over all rows i in the database of a function f applied to the data in row i, has been demonstrated in [4]. A distributed implementation eliminates the need for a trusted database administrator. \n \nThe results for noise generation are of independent interest. The generation of Gaussian noise introduces a technique for distributing shares of many unbiased coins with fewer executions of verifiable secret sharing than would be needed using previous approaches (reduced by a factor of n). The generation of exponentially distributed noise uses two shallow circuits: one for generating many arbitrarily but identically biased coins at an amortized cost of two unbiased random bits apiece, independent of the bias, and the other to combine bits of appropriate biases to obtain an exponential distribution.",

      "abstract": "We introduce a model for provable data possession (PDP) that allows a client that has stored data at an untrusted server to verify that the server possesses the original data without retrieving it. The model generates probabilistic proofs of possession by sampling random sets of blocks from the server, which drastically reduces I/O costs. The client maintains a constant amount of metadata to verify the proof. The challenge/response protocol transmits a small, constant amount of data, which minimizes network communication. Thus, the PDP model for remote data checking supports large data sets in widely-distributed storage system.\n We present two provably-secure PDP schemes that are more efficient than previous solutions, even when compared with schemes that achieve weaker guarantees. In particular, the overhead at the server is low (or even constant), as opposed to linear in the size of the data. Experiments using our implementation verify the practicality of PDP and reveal that the performance of PDP is bounded by disk I/O and not by cryptographic computation.",

That is, the noise magnitude is determined not only by the function we want to release, but also bythe database itself. One of the challenges is to ensure that the noise magnitude does not leak information about the database. To address that, we calibrate the noise magnitude to the smoothsensitivity of f on the database x --- a measure of variabilityof f in the neighborhood of the instance x. The new frameworkgreatly expands the applicability of output perturbation, a technique for protecting individuals' privacy by adding a smallamount of random noise to the released statistics. To our knowledge, this is the first formal analysis of the effect of instance-basednoise in the context of data privacy.\n Our framework raises many interesting algorithmic questions. Namely,to apply the framework one must compute or approximate the smoothsensitivity of f on x. We show how to do this efficiently for several different functions, including the median and the cost ofthe minimum spanning tree. We also give a generic procedure based on sampling that allows one to release f(x) accurately on manydatabases x. This procedure is applicable even when no efficient algorithm for approximating smooth sensitivity of f is known orwhen f is given as a black box. We illustrate the procedure by applying it to k-SED (k-means) clustering and learning mixtures of Gaussians.",

      "abstract": "We consider the problem of efficiently proving the integrity of data stored at untrusted servers. In the provable data possession (PDP) model, the client preprocesses the data and then sends it to an untrusted server for storage, while keeping a small amount of meta-data. The client later asks the server to prove that the stored data has not been tampered with or deleted (without downloading the actual data). However, the original PDP scheme applies only to static (or append-only) files.\n We present a definitional framework and efficient constructions for dynamic provable data possession (DPDP), which extends the PDP model to support provable updates to stored data. We use a new version of authenticated dictionaries based on rank information. The price of dynamic updates is a performance change from O(1) to O(logn) (or O(nεlog n), for a file consisting of n blocks, while maintaining the same (or better, respectively) probability of misbehavior detection. Our experiments show that this slowdown is very low in practice (e.g. 415KB proof size and 30ms computational overhead for a 1GB file). We also show how to apply our DPDP scheme to outsourced file systems and version control systems (e.g. CVS).",

      "abstract": "Storage outsourcing is a rising trend which prompts a number of interesting security issues, many of which have been extensively investigated in the past. However, Provable Data Possession (PDP) is a topic that has only recently appeared in the research literature. The main issue is how to frequently, efficiently and securely verify that a storage server is faithfully storing its client's (potentially very large) outsourced data. The storage server is assumed to be untrusted in terms of both security and reliability. (In other words, it might maliciously or accidentally erase hosted data; it might also relegate it to slow or off-line storage.) The problem is exacerbated by the client being a small computing device with limited resources. Prior work has addressed this problem using either public key cryptography or requiring the client to outsource its data in encrypted form.\n In this paper, we construct a highly efficient and provably secure PDP technique based entirely on symmetric key cryptography, while not requiring any bulk encryption. Also, in contrast with its predecessors, our PDP technique allows outsourcing of dynamic data, i.e, it efficiently supports operations, such as block modification, deletion and append.",

      "abstract": "We initiate the cryptographic study of order-preserving symmetric encryption (OPE), a primitive suggested in the database community by Agrawal et al. (SIGMOD '04) for allowing efficient range queries on encrypted data. Interestingly, we first show that a straightforward relaxation of standard security notions for encryption such as indistinguishability against chosen-plaintext attack (IND-CPA) is unachievable by a practical OPE scheme. Instead, we propose a security notion in the spirit of pseudorandom functions (PRFs) and related primitives asking that an OPE scheme look \"as-random-as-possible\" subject to the order-preserving constraint. We then design an efficient OPE scheme and prove its security under our notion based on pseudorandomness of an underlying blockcipher. Our construction is based on a natural relation we uncover between a random order-preserving function and the hypergeometric probability distribution. In particular, it makes black-box use of an efficient sampling algorithm for the latter.",

      "abstract": "We propose a fully homomorphic encryption scheme -- i.e., a scheme that allows one to evaluate circuits over encrypted data without being able to decrypt. Our solution comes in three steps. First, we provide a general result -- that, to construct an encryption scheme that permits evaluation of arbitrary circuits, it suffices to construct an encryption scheme that can evaluate (slightly augmented versions of) its own decryption circuit; we call a scheme that can evaluate its (augmented) decryption circuit bootstrappable.\n Next, we describe a public key encryption scheme using ideal lattices that is almost bootstrappable.\n Lattice-based cryptosystems typically have decryption algorithms with low circuit complexity, often dominated by an inner product computation that is in NC1. Also, ideal lattices provide both additive and multiplicative homomorphisms (modulo a public-key ideal in a polynomial ring that is represented as a lattice), as needed to evaluate general circuits.\n Unfortunately, our initial scheme is not quite bootstrappable -- i.e., the depth that the scheme can correctly evaluate can be logarithmic in the lattice dimension, just like the depth of the decryption circuit, but the latter is greater than the former. In the final step, we show how to modify the scheme to reduce the depth of the decryption circuit, and thereby obtain a bootstrappable encryption scheme, without reducing the depth that the scheme can evaluate. Abstractly, we accomplish this by enabling the encrypter to start the decryption process, leaving less work for the decrypter, much like the server leaves less work for the decrypter in a server-aided cryptosystem.",

      "abstract": "As Cloud Computing becomes prevalent, more and more sensitive information are being centralized into the cloud. For the protection of data privacy, sensitive data usually have to be encrypted before outsourcing, which makes effective data utilization a very challenging task. Although traditional searchable encryption schemes allow a user to securely search over encrypted data through keywords and selectively retrieve files of interest, these techniques support only exact keyword search. That is, there is no tolerance of minor typos and format inconsistencies which, on the other hand, are typical user searching behavior and happen very frequently. This significant drawback makes existing techniques unsuitable in Cloud Computing as it greatly affects system usability, rendering user searching experiences very frustrating and system efficacy very low. In this paper, for the first time we formalize and solve the problem of effective fuzzy keyword search over encrypted cloud data while maintaining keyword privacy. Fuzzy keyword search greatly enhances system usability by returning the matching files when users' searching inputs exactly match the predefined keywords or the closest possible matching files based on keyword similarity semantics, when exact match fails. In our solution, we exploit edit distance to quantify keywords similarity and develop an advanced technique on constructing fuzzy keyword sets, which greatly reduces the storage and representation overheads. Through rigorous security analysis, we show that our proposed solution is secure and privacy-preserving, while correctly realizing the goal of fuzzy keyword search.",

      "abstract": "We describe a working implementation of a variant of Gentry's fully homomorphic encryption scheme (STOC 2009), similar to the variant used in an earlier implementation effort by Smart and Vercauteren (PKC 2010). Smart and Vercauteren implemented the underlying \"somewhat homomorphic\" scheme, but were not able to implement the bootstrapping functionality that is needed to get the complete scheme to work. We show a number of optimizations that allow us to implement all aspects of the scheme, including the bootstrapping functionality. \n \nOur main optimization is a key-generation method for the underlying somewhat homomorphic encryption, that does not require full polynomial inversion. This reduces the asymptotic complexity from O(n2.5) to O(n1.5) when working with dimension-n lattices (and practically reducing the time from many hours/days to a few seconds/minutes). Other optimizations include a batching technique for encryption, a careful analysis of the degree of the decryption polynomial, and some space/time trade-offs for the fully-homomorphic scheme. \n \nWe tested our implementation with lattices of several dimensions, corresponding to several security levels. From a \"toy\" setting in dimension 512, to \"small,\" \"medium,\" and \"large\" settings in dimensions 2048, 8192, and 32768, respectively. The public-key size ranges in size from 70 Megabytes for the \"small\" setting to 2.3 Gigabytes for the \"large\" setting. The time to run one bootstrapping operation (on a 1-CPU 64- bit machine with large memory) ranges from 30 seconds for the \"small\" setting to 30 minutes for the \"large\" setting.",

      "abstract": "The prospect of outsourcing an increasing amount of data storage and management to cloud services raises many new privacy concerns for individuals and businesses alike. The privacy concerns can be satisfactorily addressed if users encrypt the data they send to the cloud. If the encryption scheme is homomorphic, the cloud can still perform meaningful computations on the data, even though it is encrypted.\n In fact, we now know a number of constructions of fully homomorphic encryption schemes that allow arbitrary computation on encrypted data. In the last two years, solutions for fully homomorphic encryption have been proposed and improved upon, but it is hard to ignore the elephant in the room, namely efficiency -- can homomorphic encryption ever be efficient enough to be practical? Certainly, it seems that all known fully homomorphic encryption schemes have a long way to go before they can be used in practice. Given this state of affairs, our contribution is two-fold.\n First, we exhibit a number of real-world applications, in the medical, financial, and the advertising domains, which require only that the encryption scheme is \"somewhat\" homomorphic. Somewhat homomorphic encryption schemes, which support a limited number of homomorphic operations, can be much faster, and more compact than fully homomorphic encryption schemes.\n Secondly, we show a proof-of-concept implementation of the recent somewhat homomorphic encryption scheme of Brakerski and Vaikuntanathan, whose security relies on the \"ring learning with errors\" (Ring LWE) problem. The scheme is very efficient, and has reasonably short ciphertexts. Our unoptimized implementation in magma enjoys comparable efficiency to even optimized pairing-based schemes with the same level of security and homomorphic capacity. We also show a number of application-specific optimizations to the encryption scheme, most notably the ability to convert between different message encodings in a ciphertext.",

Obfuscators, if they exist, would have a wide variety of cryptographic and complexity-theoretic applications, ranging from software protection to homomorphic encryption to complexity-theoretic analogues of Rice's theorem. Most of these applications are based on an interpretation of the “unintelligibility” condition in obfuscation as meaning that <i>O</i>(<i>P</i>) is a “virtual black box,” in the sense that anything one can efficiently compute given <i>O</i>(<i>P</i>), one could also efficiently compute given oracle access to <i>P</i>.\n In this work, we initiate a theoretical investigation of obfuscation. Our main result is that, even under very weak formalizations of the above intuition, obfuscation is impossible. We prove this by constructing a family of efficient programs <i>P</i> that are <i>unobfuscatable</i> in the sense that (a) given <i>any</i> efficient program <i>P</i>' that computes the same function as a program <i>P</i> ∈ <i>p</i>, the “source code” <i>P</i> can be efficiently reconstructed, yet (b) given <i>oracle access</i> to a (randomly selected) program <i>P</i> ∈ <i>p</i>, no efficient algorithm can reconstruct <i>P</i> (or even distinguish a certain bit in the code from random) except with negligible probability.\n We extend our impossibility result in a number of ways, including even obfuscators that (a) are not necessarily computable in polynomial time, (b) only approximately preserve the functionality, and (c) only need to work for very restricted models of computation (<b>TC<sup>0</sup></b>).

While payments are conducted between pseudonyms, Bit coin cannot offer strong privacy guarantees: payment transactions are recorded in a public decentralized ledger, from which much information can be deduced. Zero coin (Miers et al., IEEE S&P 2013) tackles some of these privacy issues by unlinking transactions from the payment's origin. Yet, it still reveals payments' destinations and amounts, and is limited in functionality. In this paper, we construct a full-fledged ledger-based digital currency with strong privacy guarantees. Our results leverage recent advances in zero-knowledge Succinct Non-interactive Arguments of Knowledge (zk-SNARKs). First, we formulate and construct decentralized anonymous payment schemes (DAP schemes). A DAP scheme enables users to directly pay each other privately: the corresponding transaction hides the payment's origin, destination, and transferred amount. We provide formal definitions and proofs of the construction's security. Second, we build Zero cash, a practical instantiation of our DAP scheme construction. In Zero cash, transactions are less than 1 kB and take under 6 ms to verify - orders of magnitude more efficient than the less-anonymous Zero coin and competitive with plain Bit coin.",

In this paper we introduce the concept of an aggregate signature, present security models for such signatures, and give several applications for aggregate signatures. We construct an efficient aggregate signature from a recent short signature scheme based on bilinear maps due to Boneh, Lynn, and Shacham. Aggregate signatures are useful for reducing the size of certificate chains (by aggregating all signatures in the chain) and for reducing message size in secure routing protocols such as SBGP. We also show that aggregate signatures give rise to verifiably encrypted signatures. Such signatures enable the verifier to test that a given ciphertext C is the encryption of a signature on a given message M. Verifiably encrypted signatures are used in contract-signing protocols.

For lists of length k, we obtain O(k) communication overhead and O(k ln ln k) computation. The protocol for the semi-honest environment is secure in the standard model, while the protocol for the malicious environment is secure in the random oracle model. We also consider the problem of approximating the size of the intersection, show a linear lower-bound for the communication overhead of solving this problem, and provide a suitable secure protocol. Lastly, we investigate other variants of the matching problem, including extending the protocol to the multi-party setting as well as considering the problem of approximate matching.",

In our first construction both ciphertexts and private keys are of constant size (only two group elements), for any subset of receivers.

For example, we achieve a collusion resistant broadcast system for n users where both ciphertexts and public keys are of size $O(\\sqrt{N})$ for any subset of receivers.

      "abstract": "We continue a line of research initiated in [10, 11] on privacy-preserving statistical databases. Consider a trusted server that holds a database of sensitive information. Given a query function f mapping databases to reals, the so-called true answer is the result of applying f to the database. To protect privacy, the true answer is perturbed by the addition of random noise generated according to a carefully chosen distribution, and this response, the true answer plus noise, is returned to the user. Previous work focused on the case of noisy sums, in which f = Σ i g(x i ), where x i denotes the ith row of the database and g maps database rows to [0,1]. We extend the study to general functions f, proving that privacy can be preserved by calibrating the standard deviation of the noise according to the sensitivity of the function f. Roughly speaking, this is the amount that any single argument to f can change its output. The new analysis shows that for several particular applications substantially less noise is needed than was previously understood to be the case. The first step is a very clean characterization of privacy in terms of indistinguishability of transcripts. Additionally, we obtain separation results showing the increased value of interactive sanitization mechanisms over non-interactive.",

In predicate encryption, secret keys correspond to predicates and ciphertexts are associated with attributes; the secret key SKf corresponding to a predicate f can be used to decrypt a ciphertext associated with attribute I if and only if f(I)=1. Constructions of such schemes are currently known only for certain classes of predicates.We construct a scheme for predicates corresponding to the evaluation of inner products over ℤN (for some large integer N). This, in turn, enables constructions in which predicates correspond to the evaluation of disjunctions, polynomials, CNF/DNF formulas, thresholds, and more. Besides serving as a significant step forward in the theory of predicate encryption, our results lead to a number of applications that are interesting in their own right.",

      "abstract": "We propose a Multi-Authority Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) system. In our system, any party can become an authority and there is no requirement for any global coordination other than the creation of an initial set of common reference parameters. A party can simply act as an ABE authority by creating a public key and issuing private keys to different users that reflect their attributes. A user can encrypt data in terms of any boolean formula over attributes issued from any chosen set of authorities. Finally, our system does not require any central authority. \n \nIn constructing our system, our largest technical hurdle is to make it collusion resistant. Prior Attribute-Based Encryption systems achieved collusion resistance when the ABE system authority \"tied\" together different components (representing different attributes) of a user's private key by randomizing the key. However, in our system each component will come from a potentially different authority, where we assume no coordination between such authorities. We create new techniques to tie key components together and prevent collusion attacks between users with different global identifiers. \n \nWe prove our system secure using the recent dual system encryption methodology where the security proof works by first converting the challenge ciphertext and private keys to a semi-functional form and then arguing security. We follow a recent variant of the dual system proof technique due to Lewko and Waters and build our system using bilinear groups of composite order. We prove security under similar static assumptions to the LW paper in the random oracle model.",

      "abstract": "We present a somewhat homomorphic encryption scheme that is both very simple to describe and analyze, and whose security (quantumly) reduces to the worst-case hardness of problems on ideal lattices. We then transform it into a fully homomorphic encryption scheme using standard \"squashing\" and \"bootstrapping\" techniques introduced by Gentry (STOC 2009). \n \nOne of the obstacles in going from \"somewhat\" to full homomorphism is the requirement that the somewhat homomorphic scheme be circular secure, namely, the scheme can be used to securely encrypt its own secret key. For all known somewhat homomorphic encryption schemes, this requirement was not known to be achievable under any cryptographic assumption, and had to be explicitly assumed. We take a step forward towards removing this additional assumption by proving that our scheme is in fact secure when encrypting polynomial functions of the secret key. \n \nOur scheme is based on the ring learning with errors (RLWE) assumption that was recently introduced by Lyubashevsky, Peikert and Regev (Eurocrypt 2010). The RLWE assumption is reducible to worstcase problems on ideal lattices, and allows us to completely abstract out the lattice interpretation, resulting in an extremely simple scheme. For example, our secret key is s, and our public key is (a, b = as+2e), where s, a, e are all degree (n - 1) integer polynomials whose coefficients are independently drawn from easy to sample distributions.",
