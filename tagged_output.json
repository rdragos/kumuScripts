Non-repudiation services protect the transacting parties against any false denial that a particular event or action has taken place, in which evidence will be generated, collected and maintained to enable dispute resolution. Meanwhile, fairness is a further desirable requirement such that neither party can gain an advantage by quitting prematurely or otherwise misbehaving during a transaction. In this paper, we survey the evolution of techniques and protocols that had been put forward to achieve fair non-repudiation with a (trusted) third party, and present a secure and efficient fair non-repudiation protocol.",

      "abstract": "Identity-based cryptosystems have an inherent key escrow issue, that is, the Key Generation Center (KGC) always knows user secret key. If the KGC is malicious, it can always impersonate the user. Certificateless cryptography, introduced by Al-Riyami and Paterson in 2003, is intended to solve this problem. However, in all the previously proposed certificateless schemes, it is always assumed that the malicious KGC starts launching attacks (so-called Type II attacks) only after it has generated a master public/secret key pair honestly. In this paper, we propose new security models that remove this assumption for both certificateless signature and encryption schemes. Under the new models, we show that a class of certificateless encryption and signature schemes proposed previously are insecure. These schemes still suffer from the key escrow problem. On the other side, we also give new proofs to show that there are two generic constructions, one for certificateless signature and the other for certificateless encryption, proposed recently that are secure under our new models.",

The communication complexity for securely evaluating a circuit with m multiplication gates over a finite field is O(mn2) field elements, including the communication required for simulating broadcast, but excluding some overhead costs (independent of m) for sharing the inputs and reconstructing the outputs. This corresponds to the complexity of the best known protocols for the passive model, where the corrupted players are guaranteed not to deviate from the protocol.

We propose a novel OT protocol with security in the standard model and improve OT extensions with respect to communication complexity, computation complexity, and scalability. We also provide specific optimizations of OT extensions that are tailored to the secure computation protocols of Yao and Goldreich-Micali-Wigderson and reduce the communication complexity even further. We experimentally verify the efficiency gains of our protocols and optimizations. By applying our implementation to current secure computation frameworks, we can securely compute a Levenshtein distance circuit with 1.29 billion AND gates at a rate of 1.2 million AND gates per second. Moreover, we demonstrate the importance of correctly implementing OT within secure computation protocols by presenting an attack on the FastGC framework.",

The notion assures increased security and availability of the cryptographic primitive. We present a proactive RSA system in which a threshold of servers applies the RSA signature (or decryption) function in a distributed manner; RSA is perhaps the most important trapdoor function in use. Employing new combinatorial and elementary number theoretic techniques, our protocol enables the dynamic updating of the servers (which hold the RSA key distributively); it is secure even when a linear number of the servers are corrupted during any time period (linear redundancy); it eeciently \\self-maintains\" the security of the function and its messages (ciphertexts or signatures); and it enables continuous availability, namely, correct function application using the shared key is possible at any time. We present an eecient way in which l servers can share an RSA private function so that, given 0 < < < 1: Proactive (Dynamic) Robustness: A gateway G can combine information from any set of l (honest) servers to deduce the RSA signature for any authorized message at any period. Proactive Security (against mobile adversary): Our protocol is secure against a polynomial time adversary who controls the gateway G and time-variant sets of up to minfl(1 ?); lg servers, and can obtain the shares of up to l servers (including those that it corrupts). Uniform Boundedness: The share-size is always bounded by the size of an RSA private key (i.e., logarithmically in N). We also present special practical instances based on designs; some of these instances were recently implemented as part of a highly secure application testbed at Sandia National Laboratories. A major technical diiculty in \\proactivizing\" RSA was the fact that the servers have to update the \\distributed representation\" of an RSA key, while not learning the order of the group from which keys are drawn (in order not to compromise the RSA security).",

Unlike group signatures, ring signatures have no group managers, no setup procedures, no revocation procedures, and no coordination: any user can choose any set of possible signers that includes himself, and sign any message by using his secret key and the others' public keys, without getting their approval or assistance. Ring signatures provide an elegant way to leak authoritative secrets in an anonymous way, to sign casual email in a way which can only be verified by its intended recipient, and to solve other problems in multiparty computations. The main contribution of this paper is a new construction of such signatures which is unconditionally signer-ambiguous, provably secure in the random oracle model, and exceptionally efficient: adding each ring member increases the cost of signing or verifying by a single modular multiplication and a single symmetric encryption.",

In response, creative adversaries have begun circumventing these defenses by exploiting programming errors to manipulate pointers to virtual tables, or vtables, of C++ objects. These attacks can hijack program control flow whenever a virtual method of a corrupted object is called, potentially allowing the attacker to gain complete control of the underlying system. In this paper we present SAFEDISPATCH, a novel defense to prevent such vtable hijacking by statically analyzing C++ programs and inserting sufficient runtime checks to ensure that control flow at virtual method call sites cannot be arbitrarily influenced by an attacker. We implemented SAFEDISPATCH as a Clang++/LLVM extension, used our enhanced compiler to build a vtable-safe version of the Google Chromium browser, and measured the performance overhead of our approach on popular browser benchmark suites. By carefully crafting a handful of optimizations, we were able to reduce average runtime overhead to just 2.1%.",

However, all current techniques for secure MPC apply to functions that are represented by (boolean or arithmetic) circuits over finite fields. We are motivated by two limitations of these techniques: - GENERALITY. Existing protocols do not apply to computation over more general algebraic structures (except via a brute-force simulation of computation in these structures). - EFFICIENCY. The best known constant-round protocols do not efficiently scale even to the case of large finite fields. \n \nOur contribution goes in these two directions. First, we propose a basis for unconditionally secure MPC over an arbitrary finite ring, an algebraic object with a much less nice structure than a field, and obtain efficient MPC protocols requiring only a black-box access to the ring operations and to random ring elements. Second, we extend these results to the constant-round setting, and suggest efficiency improvements that are relevant also for the important special case of fields. We demonstrate the usefulness of the above results by presenting a novel application of MPC over (non-field) rings to the round-efficient secure computation of the maximum function.",

The first component $\\mathcal{H}$, which is a \"collision resistant\" hash, maps a string to an unordered set, whereby existing schemes on unordered sets can then be applied. However, a sequence of random numbers has to be explicitly stored and thus it produces a large signature of size at least (mk )-bits where m is the number of objects and k is the size of a key sufficiently large for cryptographic operations. The second component uses RGGM tree, a variant of GGM tree, to generate the pseudo random numbers from a short seed, expected to be of size O (k + tk logm ) where t is the number of removed substrings. Unlike GGM tree, the structure of the proposed RGGM tree is random. By an intriguing statistical property of the random tree, the redacted tree does not reveal the lengths of the substrings removed. The hash function $\\mathcal{H}$ and the RGGM tree can be of independent interests.",

We present a new representation system called extended DBNS whose expansions can be extremely sparse. When compared with double-base chains, the average length of extended DBNS expansions of integers of size in the range 200–500 bits is approximately reduced by 20% using one precomputed point, 30% using two, and 38% using four. We also discuss a new approach to approximate an integer n by d2a3b where d belongs to a given digit set. This method, which requires some precomputations as well, leads to realistic DBNS implementations. Finally, a left-to-right scalar multiplication relying on extended DBNS is given. On an elliptic curve where operations are performed in Jacobian coordinates, improvements of up to 13% overall can be expected with this approach when compared to window NAF methods using the same number of precomputed points. In this context, it is therefore the fastest method known to date to compute a scalar multiplication on a generic elliptic curve.",

This allows a simple and intuitive understanding of its security. Second, our proof of security is significantly simpler and more modular. Third, we are able to derive analogues to the Katz et al. protocol under additional cryptographic assumptions.

The algorithms are efficient and allow to study linear and affine equivalences for bijective S-boxes of all popular sizes (LE is efficient up to n ≤ 32). Using these tools new equivalent representations are found for a variety of ciphers: Rijndael, DES, Camellia, Serpent, Misty, Kasumi, Khazad, etc. The algorithms are furthermore extended for the case of non-bijective n to m-bit S-boxes with a small value of |n - m| and for the case of almost equivalent S-boxes. The algorithms also provide new attacks on a generalized Even-Mansour scheme. Finally, the paper defines a new problem of S-box decomposition in terms of Substitution Permutations Networks (SPN) with layers of smaller S-boxes. Simple information-theoretic bounds are proved for such decompositions.",

The best known upper bound on the rate S at which such key bits can be generated has been the intrinsic information of the distribution modeling the parties', including the adversary's, knowledge. Based on a new property of the secret-key rate S, we introduce a conditional mutual information measure which is a stronger upper bound on S. Having thus seen that the intrinsic information of a distribution P is not always suitable for determining the number of secret bits extractable from P, we prove a different significance of it in the same context: It is a lower bound on the number of key bits required to generate P by public communication. Taken together, these two results imply that sometimes, (a possibly arbitrarily large fraction of) the correlation contained in distributed information cannot be extracted in the form of secret keys by any protocol.",

In this paper, we explore the notion that targeted advertising and privacy protection need not necessarily be conflicting goals. We describe some conceptually simple technical schemes that facilitate targeted advertising, but also offer protection for sensitive consumer data. Some simple proposals do not even require the use of cryptography. (As an example, we mention an existing scheme in commercial deployment.)

We consider the case of both writing and reading. While the case of reading was well studied before, the case of writing was previously completely open. In this paper, we show how to implement both read and write operations, with the following strong security guarantees: all the information about the read/write operation is information-theoretically hidden from all the databases (i.e. both the value of the bit and the address of the bit). As in the previous papers, we measure, as a function of k and n the amount of communication required between a user and all the databases for a single read/write operation, and achieve eecient read/write schemes. Moreover, we show a general reduction from reading database scheme to reading and writing database scheme, with the following guarantees: for any k, given a retrieval only k-database scheme with communication complexity R(k; n) we show a (k + 1) reading and writing database scheme with total communication complexity O R(k; n) (log n) O(1). Our general reduction in combination with the paper of Chor,Goldreich,Kushilevtiz,Sudan] yields: a 3-database scheme with read/write communication complexity of O n 1=3 (log n) 3 ; for all constants k 2, a (k + 1)-database scheme with read/write communication complexity of O n 1=k (log n) 3 ; O(log n)-database scheme with read/write communication complexity of O ? (log n) 3. It should be stressed that prior to the current paper no trivial (i.e. sub-linear) bounds for private information storage were known. Moreover, our result yields a solution to the problem of information-theoretically secure Oblivious RAM simulation with poly-log overhead in the above setting. Our result also implies that eecient instance-hiding schemes where the state can be altered are possible.",

      "abstract": "We propose Bulletproofs, a new non-interactive zero-knowledge proof protocol with very short proofs and without a trusted setup; the proof size is only logarithmic in the witness size. Bulletproofs are especially well suited for efficient range proofs on committed values: they enable proving that a committed value is in a range using only 2 log_2(n)+9 group and field elements, where n is the bit length of the range. Proof generation and verification times are linear in n. Bulletproofs greatly improve on the linear (in n) sized range proofs in existing proposals for confidential transactions in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Moreover, Bulletproofs supports aggregation of range proofs, so that a party can prove that m commitments lie in a given range by providing only an additive O(log(m)) group elements over the length of a single proof. To aggregate proofs from multiple parties, we enable the parties to generate a single proof without revealing their inputs to each other via a simple multi-party computation (MPC) protocol for constructing Bulletproofs. This MPC protocol uses either a constant number of rounds and linear communication, or a logarithmic number of rounds and logarithmic communication. We show that verification time, while asymptotically linear, is very efficient in practice. The marginal cost of batch verifying 32 aggregated range proofs is less than the cost of verifying 32 ECDSA signatures. Bulletproofs build on the techniques of Bootle et al. (EUROCRYPT 2016). Beyond range proofs, Bulletproofs provide short zero-knowledge proofs for general arithmetic circuits while only relying on the discrete logarithm assumption and without requiring a trusted setup. We discuss many applications that would benefit from Bulletproofs, primarily in the area of cryptocurrencies. The efficiency of Bulletproofs is particularly well suited for the distributed and trustless nature of blockchains. The full version of this article is available on ePrint.",

In this model, we construct public-key encryption schemes, digital signatures, and identity-based encryption schemes that remain secure even if an attacker can leak a constant fraction of the secret memory (including the secret key) in each time period between key updates. We also consider attackers who may probe the secret memory during the updates themselves.

We go on to give an improved analysis of the encrypted CBC MAC, where there is no restriction on queried messages. Letting m be the block length of the longest query, our bounds are about mq2/2n for the basic CBC MAC and mo(1)q2/2n for the encrypted CBC MAC, improving prior bounds of m2q2/2n.

      "abstract": "Secure function evaluation (SFE) allows a set of mutually distrustful parties to evaluate a function of their joint inputs without revealing their inputs to each other. SFE has been the focus of active research and recent work suggests that it can be made practical. Unfortunately, current protocols and implementations have inherent limitations that are hard to overcome using standard and practical techniques. Among them are: (1) requiring participants to do work linear in the size of the circuit representation of the function; (2) requiring all parties to do the same amount of work; and (3) not being able to provide complete fairness.\n A promising approach for overcoming these limitations is to augment the SFE setting with a small set of untrusted servers that have no input to the computation and that receive no output, but that make their computational resources available to the parties. In this model, referred to as server-aided SFE, the goal is to tradeoff the parties' work at the expense of the servers. Motivated by the emergence of public cloud services such as Amazon EC2 and Microsoft Azure, recent work has explored the extent to which server-aided SFE can be achieved with a single server.\n In this work, we revisit the sever-aided setting from a practical perspective and design single-server-aided SFE protocols that are considerably more efficient than all previously-known protocols. We achieve this in part by introducing several new techniques for garbled-circuit-based protocols, including a new and efficient input-checking mechanism for cut-and-choose and a new pipelining technique that works in the presence of malicious adversaries. Furthermore, we extend the server-aided model to guarantee fairness which is an important property to achieve in practice.\n Finally, we implement and evaluate our constructions experimentally and show that our protocols (regardless of the number of parties involved) yield implementations that are 4 and 6 times faster than the most optimized two-party SFE implementation when the server is assumed to be malicious and covert, respectively.",

It is impossible to prove security of the TLS Handshake protocol in any classical key-indistinguishability-based security model like for instance the Bellare-Rogaway or the Canetti-Krawczyk model, due to subtle issues with the encryption of the final Finished messages. Therefore we start with proving the security of a truncated version of the TLS-DHE Handshake protocol, which has been considered in previous works on TLS. Then we define the notion of authenticated and confidential channel establishment ACCE as a new security model which captures precisely the security properties expected from TLS in practice, and show that the combination of the TLS Handshake with data encryption in the TLS Record Layer can be proven secure in this model.",

Alice gains no knowledge of Bob’s credentials in the process, and hence the name “Hidden Credentials.” Research on Hidden Credential systems has focused on messages sent to single recipients, where the sender needs to know the recipient’s pseudonym beforehand, and on Hidden Policies, where Bob learns as little information as possible about Alice’s policy for decrypting the message. Current schemes provide weak policy privacy — with non-interactive schemes, the recipient can learn parts of the policy, and with interactive schemes based on secure multiparty computation, a user can try different sets of credentials as input to gain knowledge of the policy after repeated decryption attempts. Furthermore, existing schemes do not support policies with negations efficiently. For example, a policy stating “Bob is not a student” is hard to enforce since Bob can simply withhold, or not use, his student credential. We propose a system called PEAPOD (PrivacyEnhanced Attribute-based Publishing Of Data) that provides the following properties: (1) Users can securely publish data protected by attribute-based policies to multiple possible recipients without requiring interaction between senders and receivers. This is achieved by using a semitrusted server. (2) The plaintext message and the policy are completely hidden from the server. (3) Any recipient, intended or not, learns no other information about a message’s policy beyond the number of clauses in policy that were satisfied. Furthermore the recipient is forced to use all of his or her issued credentials for decryption, and therefore cannot mount inference attacks by trying to decrypt the ∗This research was supported in part by the NSF, under grant CNS0524695, and the Bureau of Justice Assistance, under grant 2005-DD-BX1091.

      "abstract": "We describe a working implementation of leveled homomorphic encryption without bootstrapping that can evaluate the AES-128 circuit in three different ways. One variant takes under over 36 hours to evaluate an entire AES encryption operation, using NTL over GMP as our underlying software platform, and running on a large-memory machine. Using SIMD techniques, we can process over 54 blocks in each evaluation, yielding an amortized rate of just under 40 minutes per block. Another implementation takes just over two and a half days to evaluate the AES operation, but can process 720 blocks in each evaluation, yielding an amortized rate of just over five minutes per block. We also detail a third implementation, which theoretically could yield even better amortized complexity, but in practice turns out to be less competitive. \n \nFor our implementations we develop both AES-specific optimizations as well as several \"generic\" tools for FHE evaluation. These last tools include among others a different variant of the Brakerski-Vaikuntanathan key-switching technique that does not require reducing the norm of the ciphertext vector, and a method of implementing the Brakerski-Gentry-Vaikuntanathan modulus-switching transformation on ciphertexts in CRT representation.",

This paper brings three contributions with respect to its applicability to practice. First, we emphasize that the MIA principle can be seen as a toolbox in which different (more or less effective) statistical methods can be plugged in. Doing this, we introduce interesting alternatives to the original proposal. Second, we discuss the contexts in which the MIA can lead to successful key recoveries with lower data complexity than classical attacks such as, e.g . using Pearson's correlation coefficient. We show that such contexts exist in practically meaningful situations and analyze them statistically. Finally, we study the connections and differences between the MIA and a framework for the analysis of side-channel key recovery published at Eurocrypt 2009. We show that the MIA can be used to compare two leaking devices only if the discrete models used by an adversary to mount an attack perfectly correspond to the physical leakages.",

For Edwards curves the formulas come from a new way of seeing the arithmetic. We state the first geometric interpretation of the group law on Edwards curves by presenting the functions which arise in addition and doubling. The Tate pairing on Edwards curves can be computed by using these functions in Miller's algorithm. Computing the sum of two points or the double of a point and the coefficients of the corresponding functions is faster with our formulas than with all previously proposed formulas for pairings on Edwards curves. They are even competitive with all published formulas for pairing computation on Weierstrass curves. We also improve the formulas for Tate pairing computation on Weierstrass curves in Jacobian coordinates. Finally, we present several examples of pairing-friendly Edwards curves.

      "abstract": "An OT-combiner implements a secure oblivious transfer (OT) protocol using oracle access to n OT-candidates of which at most t may be faulty.We introduce a newgeneral approach for combining OTs by making a simple and modular use of protocols for secure computation. Specifically, we obtain an OT-combiner from any instantiation of the following two ingredients: (1) a t-secure n-party protocol for the OT functionality, in a network consisting of secure point-to-point channels and a broadcast primitive; and (2) a secure two-party protocol for a functionality determined by the former multiparty protocol, in a network consisting of a single OT-channel. Our approach applies both to the \"semi-honest\" and the \"malicious\" models of secure computation, yielding the corresponding types of OT-combiners. \n \nInstantiating our general approach with secure computation protocols from the literature, we conceptually simplify, strengthen the security, and improve the efficiency of previous OT-combiners. In particular, we obtain the first constant-rate OT-combiners in which the number of secure OTs being produced is a constant fraction of the total number of calls to the OT-candidates, while still tolerating a constant fraction of faulty candidates (t = Ω(n)). Previous OT-combiners required either ω(n) or poly(k) calls to the n candidates, where k is a security parameter, and produced only a single secure OT. \n \nWe demonstrate the usefulness of the latter result by presenting several applications that are of independent interest. These include: Constant-rate OTs from a noisy channel. We implement n instances of a standard (2 1)-OT by communicating just O(n) bits over a noisy channel (binary symmetric channel). Our reduction provides unconditional security in the semi-honest model. Previous reductions of this type required the use of Ω(kn) noisy bits. Better amortized generation of OTs. We show that, following an initial \"seed\" of O(k) OTs, each additional OT can be generated by only computing and communicating a constant number of outputs of a cryptographic hash function. This improves over a protocol of Ishai et al. (Crypto 2003), which obtained similar efficiency in the semi-honest model but required Ω(k) applications of the hash function for generating each OT in the malicious model.",

      "abstract": "Cache-based attacks are a class of side-channel attacks that are particularly effective in virtualized or cloud-based environments, where they have been used to recover secret keys from cryptographic implementations. One common approach to thwart cache-based attacks is to use constant-time implementations, i.e., which do not branch on secrets and do not perform memory accesses that depend on secrets. However, there is no rigorous proof that constant-time implementations are protected against concurrent cache-attacks in virtualization platforms with shared cache; moreover, many prominent implementations are not constant-time. An alternative approach is to rely on system-level mechanisms. One recent such mechanism is stealth memory, which provisions a small amount of private cache for programs to carry potentially leaking computations securely. Stealth memory induces a weak form of constant-time, called S-constant-time, which encompasses some widely used cryptographic implementations. However, there is no rigorous analysis of stealth memory and S-constant-time, and no tool support for checking if applications are S-constant-time.\n We propose a new information-flow analysis that checks if an x86 application executes in constant-time, or in S-constant-time. Moreover, we prove that constant-time (resp. S-constant-time) programs do not leak confidential information through the cache to other operating systems executing concurrently on virtualization platforms (resp. platforms supporting stealth memory). The soundness proofs are based on new theorems of independent interest, including isolation theorems for virtualization platforms (resp. platforms supporting stealth memory), and proofs that constant-time implementations (resp. S-constant-time implementations) are non-interfering with respect to a strict information flow policy which disallows that control flow and memory accesses depend on secrets. We formalize our results using the Coq proof assistant and we demonstrate the effectiveness of our analyses on cryptographic implementations, including PolarSSL AES, DES and RC4, SHA256 and Salsa20.",

Such ciphers are desirable for many future pervasive applications with real-time security needs. Our cipher, named PRINCE, allows encryption of data within one clock cycle with a very competitive chip area compared to known solutions. The fully unrolled fashion in which such algorithms need to be implemented calls for innovative design choices. The number of rounds must be moderate and rounds must have short delays in hardware. At the same time, the traditional need that a cipher has to be iterative with very similar round functions disappears, an observation that increases the design space for the algorithm. An important further requirement is that realizing decryption and encryption results in minimum additional costs. PRINCE is designed in such a way that the overhead for decryption on top of encryption is negligible. More precisely for our cipher it holds that decryption for one key corresponds to encryption with a related key. This property we refer to as α-reflection is of independent interest and we prove its soundness against generic attacks.",

This automaton is very similar to the classical LFSR generators, except the fact that it performs operations with carries. Its properties are well mastered: proved period, non-degenerated states, good statistical properties, high non-linearity. \n \nThe only problem to use such an automaton directly is the fact that the mathematical structure (2-adic fraction) can be retrieved from few bits of its output using an analog of the Berlekamp-Massey algorithm. \n \nTo mask this structure, we propose to use a filter on the cells of the FCSR automaton. Due to the high non-linearity of this automaton, the best filter is simply a linear filter, that is a XOR on some internal states. We call such a generator a Filtered FCSR (F-FCSR) generator. \n \nWe propose four versions of our generator: the first uses a static filter with a single output at each iteration of the generator (F-FCSR-SF1). A second with an 8 bit output (F-FCSR-SF8). The third and the fourth are similar, but use a dynamic filter depending on the key (F-FCSR-DF1 and F-FCSR-DF8). We give limitations on the use of the static filter versions, in scope of the time/memory/data tradeoff attack. \n \nThese stream ciphers are very fast and efficient, especially for hardware implementations.",

In such an environment Nash equilibria represent stable states of the system: no user can improve its private latency by unilaterally changing its strategy. \n \nNashification is the problem of converting any given non-equilibrium routing into a Nash equilibrium without increasing the social cost. Our first result is an O(nm2) time algorithm for Nashification. This algorithm can be used in combination with any approximation algorithm for the routing problem to compute a Nash equilibrium of the same quality. In particular, this approach yields a PTAS for the computation of a best Nash equilibrium. Furthermore, we prove a lower bound of Ω(2√n) and an upper bound of O(2n) for the number of greedy selfish steps for identical link capacities in the worst case. \n \nIn the second part of the paper we introduce a new structural parameter which allows us to slightly improve the upper bound on the coordination ratio for pure Nash equilibria in [3]. The new bound holds for the individual coordination ratio and is asymptotically tight. Additionally, we prove that the known upper bound of 1+√4m-3/2 on the coordination ratio for pure Nash equilibria also holds for the individual coordination ratio in case of mixed Nash equilibria, and we determine the range of m for which this bound is tight.",

      "abstract": "A cryptographic primitive is leakage-resilient, if it remains secure even if an adversary can learn a bounded amount of arbitrary information about the computation with every invocation. As a consequence, the physical implementation of a leakage-resilient primitive is secure against every side-channel as long as the amount of information leaked per invocation is bounded. \n \nIn this paper we prove positive and negative results about the feasibility of constructing leakage-resilient pseudorandom functions and permutations (i.e. block-ciphers). Our results are three fold: 1. We construct (from any standard PRF) a PRF which satisfies a relaxed notion of leakage-resilience where (1) the leakage function is fixed (and not adaptively chosen with each query.) and (2) the computation is split into several steps which leak individually (a \"step\" will be the invocation of the underlying PRF.) 2. We prove that a Feistel network with a super-logarithmic number of rounds, each instantiated with a leakage-resilient PRF, is a leakage resilient PRP. This reduction also holds for the non-adaptive notion just discussed, we thus get a block-cipher which is leakage-resilient (against non-adaptive leakage). 3. We propose generic side-channel attacks against Feistel networks. The attacks are generic in the sense that they work for any round functions (e.g. uniformly random functions) and only require some simple leakage from the inputs to the round functions. For example we show how to invert an r round Feistel network over 2n bits making 4ċ(n+1)r-2 forward queries, if with each query we are also given as leakage the Hamming weight of the inputs to the r round functions. This complements the result from the previous item showing that a super-constant number of rounds is necessary.",

Most cryptographic workloads pose a considerable burden on devices like PDAs, cell phones, and sensor nodes, which are limited in processing power, memory and energy. In this paper we present an approach to increase the efficiency of 32-bit processors for handling symmetric cryptographic algorithms with the help of instruction set extensions. We propose a number of custom instructions to support the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). Using the SPARC V8-compatible Leon2 embedded processor, we evaluate the effects of the extensions on performance and code size of AES, as well as on silicon area. With a moderate increase in silicon area, AES performance can be improved by a factor of nearly 10, while code size is reduced significantly and implementation flexibility is retained. We also show that our approach is very beneficial for implementation in superscalar processors and that it can compete with the performance of previously proposed cryptographic processors and instruction set extensions.",

In this paper we present a new dynamic SSE scheme that is simpler and more efficient than existing schemes while revealing less information to the server than prior schemes, achieving fully adaptive security against honest-but-curious servers. We implemented a prototype of our scheme and demonstrated its efficiency on datasets from prior work. Apart from its concrete efficiency, our scheme is also simpler: in particular, it does not require the server to support any operation other than upload and download of data. Thus the server in our scheme can be based solely on a cloud storage service, rather than a cloud computation service as well, as in prior work. In building our dynamic SSE scheme, we introduce a new primitive called Blind Storage, which allows a client to store a set of files on a remote server in such a way that the server does not learn how many files are stored, or the lengths of the individual files, as each file is retrieved, the server learns about its existence (and can notice the same file being downloaded subsequently), but the file's name and contents are not revealed. This is a primitive with several applications other than SSE, and is of independent interest.",

If the attacker has access to an unlimited number of instances, we show that the attack complexity is significantly lower, in fact the number of security bits is divided by a number slightly smaller than 3/2 (but larger than 1).

We describe a few authenticated key agreement (AK) protocols and AK with key confirmation (AKC) protocols by modifying Smart's AK protocol (2002). We discuss the security of these protocols heuristically and give formal proofs of security for our AK and AKC protocols (using a security model based on the model defined in (Blake-Wilson et al., 1997)). We also prove that our AK protocol has the key compromise impersonation property. We also show that our second protocol has the TA forward secrecy property (which we define to mean that the compromise of the TA's private key will not compromise previously established session keys), and we note that this also implies that it has the perfect forward secrecy property.",

      "abstract": "The advent of cloud computing has ushered in an era of mass data storage in remote servers. Remote data storage offers reduced data management overhead for data owners in a cost effective manner. Sensitive documents, however, need to be stored in encrypted format due to security concerns. But, encrypted storage makes it difficult to search on the stored documents. Therefore, this poses a major barrier towards selective retrieval of encrypted documents from the remote servers. Various protocols have been proposed for keyword search over encrypted data to address this issue. Most of the available protocols leak data access patterns due to efficiency reasons. Although, oblivious RAM based protocols can be used to hide data access patterns, such protocols are computationally intensive and do not scale well for real world datasets. In this paper, we introduce a novel attack that exploits data access pattern leakage to disclose significant amount of sensitive information using a modicum of prior knowledge. Our empirical analysis with a real world dataset shows that the proposed attack is able to disclose sensitive information with a very high accuracy. Additionally, we propose a simple technique to mitigate the risk against the proposed attack at the expense of a slight increment in computational resources and communication cost. Furthermore, our proposed mitigation technique is generic enough to be used in conjunction with any searchable encryption scheme that reveals data access pattern.",

In particular, we show that any protocol solely composed of subprotocols which are auxiliary-input zero-knowledge is itself auxiliary-input zero-knowledge. We show that blackbox-simulation zero-knowledge implies auxiliary-input zero-knowledge (which in turn implies the [GMR1] definition). We argue that all known zero-knowledge proofs are in fact blackbox-simulation zero-knowledge (i.e., we proved zero-knowledge using blackbox-simulation of the verifier). As a result, all known zero-knowledge proof systems are shown to be auxiliary-input zero-knowledge and can be used for cryptographic applications such as those in [GMW2].We demonstrate the triviality of certain classes of zero-knowledge proof systems, in the sense that only languages in BPP have zero-knowledge proofs of these classes.

To further address the concern of user access privacy, privacy-aware ABE schemes are being developed to achieve hidden access policy recently. For the purpose of secure access control, there is, however, still one critical functionality missing in the existing ABE schemes, which is user accountability. Currently, no ABE scheme can completely prevent the problem of illegal key sharing among users. In this paper, we tackle this problem by firstly proposing the notion of accountable, anonymous, and ciphertext-policy ABE (CP-A3BE, in short) and then giving out a concrete construction. We start by improving the state-of-the-art of anonymous CP-ABE to obtain shorter public parameters and ciphertext length. In the proposed CP-A3BE construction, user accountability can be achieved in black-box model by embedding additional user-specific information into the attribute private key issued to that user, while still maintaining hidden access policy.

      "abstract": "We consider the problem of delegating computation, where the delegator doesn't even know the input to the function being delegated, and runs in time significantly smaller than the input length. \n \nFor example, consider the setting of memory delegation, where a delegator wishes to delegate her entire memory to the cloud. The delegator may want the cloud to compute functions on this memory, and prove that the functions were computed correctly. As another example, consider the setting of streaming delegation, where a stream of data goes by, and a delegator, who cannot store this data, delegates this task to the cloud. Later the delegator may ask the cloud to compute statistics on this streaming data, and prove the correctness of the computation. We note that in both settings the delegator must keep a (short) certificate of the data being delegated, in order to later verify the correctness of the computations. Moreover, in the streaming setting, this certificate should be computed in a streaming manner. \n \nWe construct both memory and streaming delegation schemes. We present non-interactive constructions based on the (standard) delegation scheme of Goldwasswer et. al. [GKR08]. These schemes allow the delegation of any function computable by an L-uniform circuit of low depth (the complexity of the delegator depends linearly on the depth). For memory delegation, we rely on the existence of a polylog PIR scheme, and for streaming, we rely on the existence of a fully homomorphic encryption scheme. \n \nWe also present constructions based on the CS-proofs of Micali. These schemes allow the delegation of any function in P. However, they are interactive (i.e., consists of 4 messages), or are non-interactive in the Random Oracle Model.",

      "abstract": "Abstract. We present a model for attacking various cryptographic schemes by taking advantage of random hardware faults. The model consists of a black-box containing some cryptographic secret. The box interacts with the outside world by following a cryptographic protocol. The model supposes that from time to time the box is affected by a random hardware fault causing it to output incorrect values. For example, the hardware fault flips an internal register bit at some point during the computation. We show that for many digital signature and identification schemes these incorrect outputs completely expose the secrets stored in the box. We present the following results: (1) The secret signing key used in an implementation of RSA based on the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) is completely exposed from a single erroneous RSA signature, (2) for non-CRT implementations of RSA the secret key is exposed given a large number (e.g. 1000) of erroneous signatures, (3) the secret key used in Fiat—Shamir identification is exposed after a small number (e.g. 10) of faulty executions of the protocol, and (4) the secret key used in Schnorr's identification protocol is exposed after a much larger number (e.g. 10,000) of faulty executions. Our estimates for the number of necessary faults are based on standard security parameters such as a 1024-bit modulus, and a 2-40 identification error probability. Our results demonstrate the importance of preventing errors in cryptographic computations. We conclude the paper with various methods for preventing these attacks.",

Our signature scheme is more effective in many applications (e.g., blind signatures, group signatures, anonymous credentials etc.) than the existing secure signature schemes in the standard model such as the Boneh-Boyen [6], Camenisch-Lysyanskaya [10], Cramer-Shoup [15] and Waters [33] schemes (and their variants). The security proof of our scheme requires a slightly stronger assumption, the 2SDH assumption, than the SDH assumption used by Boneh-Boyen. As typical applications of our signature scheme, this paper presents efficient blind signatures and partially blind signatures that are secure in the standard model. Here, partially blind signatures are a generalization of blind signatures (i.e., blind signatures are a special case of partially blind signatures) and have many applications including electronic cash and voting. Our blind signature scheme is much more efficient than the existing secure blind signature schemes in the standard model such as the Camenisch-Koprowski-Warinsch [8] and Juels-Luby-Ostrovsky [22] schemes, and is also almost as efficient as the most efficient blind signature schemes whose security has been analyzed heuristically or in the random oracle model. Our partially blind signature scheme is the first one that is secure in the standard model and it is very efficient (almost as efficient as our blind signatures). We also present a blind signature scheme based on the Waters signature scheme.",

However this construction cannot be implemented efficiently. If Alice and Bob are willing to reveal an arbitrarily small amount of additional information (beyond the minimum) then they can implement polynomial-time protocols.

We study the time complexity of approximating <i>weighted</i> (undirected) shortest paths on distributed networks with a <i>O</i> (log <i>n</i>) <i>bandwidth restriction</i> on edges (the standard synchronous CONGEST model). The question whether approximation algorithms help speed up the shortest paths and distance computation (more precisely distance computation) was raised since at least 2004 by Elkin (SIGACT News 2004). The unweighted case of this problem is well-understood while its weighted counterpart is fundamental problem in the area of distributed approximation algorithms and remains widely open. We present new algorithms for computing both single-source shortest paths (SSSP) and all-pairs shortest paths (APSP) in the weighted case.\n Our main result is an algorithm for SSSP. Previous results are the classic <i>O</i>(<i>n</i>)-time Bellman-Ford algorithm and an <i>Õ</i>(<i>n</i><sup>1/2+1/2<i>k</i></sup> + <i>D</i>)-time (8<i>k</i>⌈log(<i>k</i> + 1)⌉ --1)-approximation algorithm, for any integer <i>k</i> ≥ 1, which follows from the result of Lenzen and Patt-Shamir (STOC 2013). (Note that Lenzen and Patt-Shamir in fact solve a harder problem, and we use <i>Õ</i>(·) to hide the <i>O</i>(poly log <i>n</i>) term.) We present an <i>Õ</i> (<i>n</i><sup>1/2</sup><i>D</i><sup>1/4</sup> + <i>D</i>)-time (1 + <i>o</i>(1))-approximation algorithm for SSSP. This algorithm is <i>sublinear-time</i> as long as <i>D</i> is sublinear, thus yielding a sublinear-time algorithm with almost optimal solution. When <i>D</i> is small, our running time matches the lower bound of <i>Ω</i>(<i>n</i><sup>1/2</sup> + <i>D</i>) by Das Sarma et al. (SICOMP 2012), which holds even when D=Θ(log n), up to a poly log <i>n</i> factor.\n As a by-product of our technique, we obtain a simple <i>Õ</i> (<i>n</i>)-time (1+ <i>o</i>(1))-approximation algorithm for APSP, improving the previous Õ(<i>n</i>)-time <i>O</i>(1)-approximation algorithm following from the results of Lenzen and Patt-Shamir. We also prove a matching lower bound. Our techniques also yield an <i>Õ</i>(<i>n</i><sup>1/2</sup>) time algorithm on fully-connected networks, which guarantees an exact solution for SSSP and a (2+ <i>o</i>(1))-approximate solution for APSP. All our algorithms rely on two new simple tools: <i>light-weight algorithm for bounded-hop</i> SSSP and <i>shortest-path diameter reduction via shortcuts</i>. These tools might be of an independent interest and useful in designing other distributed algorithms.",

      "abstract": "Several new approaches for detecting malicious attacks on computer systems and/or confining untrusted or malicious applications have emerged over the past several years. These techniques often rely on the fact that when a system is attacked from a remote location over a network, damage can ultimately be inflicted only via system calls made by processes running on the target system. This factor has lead to a surge of interest in developing infrastructures that enable secure interception and modification of system calls made by processes running on the target system. Most known approaches for solving this problem have relied on an in-kernel approach, where the interception mechanisms as well as the intrusion detection/confinement systems are implemented within the operating system kernel. We explore an alternative approach that uses mechanisms provided by most variants of the UNIX operating system to implement system call interposition at user level, where the system calls made by one process are monitored by another process. Some of the key problems that need to solved in developing such an approach are: providing adequate set of capabilities in the infrastructure, portability of the security enhancements and the infrastructure itself across different operating systems, and minimizing performance overheads associated with interception for a wide range of applications. We present a solution that satisfactorily addresses these issues, and can thus lead to a platform for rapid development and deployment of robust intrusion detectors, confinement systems and other application-specific security en-",

      "abstract": "Research on secure multiparty computation has mainly concentrated on the case where the parties can authenticate each other and the communication between them. This work addresses the question of what security can be guaranteed when authentication is not available. We consider a completely unauthenticated setting, where all messages sent by the parties may be tampered with and modified by the adversary without the uncorrupted parties being able to detect this fact. In this model, it is not possible to achieve the same level of security as in the authenticated-channel setting. Nevertheless, we show that meaningful security guarantees can be provided: Essentially, all the adversary can do is to partition the network into disjoint sets, where in each set the computation is secure in of itself, and also independent of the computation in the other sets. In this setting we provide, for the first time, nontrivial security guarantees in a model with no setup assumptions whatsoever. We also obtain similar results while guaranteeing universal composability, in some variants of the common reference string model. Finally, our protocols can be used to provide conceptually simple and unified solutions to a number of problems that were studied separately in the past, including password-based authenticated key exchange and nonmalleable commitments. As an application of our results, we study the question of constructing secure protocols in partially authenticated networks, where some of the links are authenticated, and some are not (as is the case in most networks today).",

      "abstract": "We present a statistically-hiding commitment scheme allowing commitment to arbitrary size integers, based on any (Abelian) group with certain properties, most importantly, that it is hard for the committer to compute its order. We also give efficient zero-knowledge protocols for proving knowledge of the contents of commitments and for verifying multiplicative relations over the integers on committed values. The scheme can be seen as a generalization, with a slight modification, of the earlier scheme of Fujisaki and Okamoto [14]. The reasons we revisit the earlier scheme and give some modification to it are as follows: - The earlier scheme [14] has some gaps in the proof of soundness of the associated protocols, one of which presents a non-trivial problem which, to the best of our knowledge, has remained open until now. We fill all the gaps here using additional ideas including minor modification of the form of a commitment. - Although related works such as [8, 3, 10, 4] do not suffer from the main problem we solve here, the reason for this is that they use \"commitments\" with a single base (i.e., of form c = gs mod n). Such commitments, however, cannot satisfy the standard hiding property for commitments, and hence protocols using them cannot in general be (honest-verifier) zero-knowledge nor witness indistinguishable. - In a computationally convincing proof of knowledge where the prover produces the common input (which is the type of protocol we look at here), one cannot completely exclude the possibility that a prover manages to produce a common input on which he can cheat easily. This means that the standard definition of proofs of knowledge cannot be satisfied. Therefore we introduce a new definition for computationally convincing proofs of knowledge, designed to handle the case where the common input is chosen by the (possibly cheating) prover. - Our results apply to any group with suitable properties. In particular, they apply to a much larger class of RSA moduli than the safe prime products proposed in [14] - Potential examples include RSA moduli, class groups and, with a slight modification, even non-Abelian groups.Our scheme can replace the earlier one in various other constructions, such as the efficient interval proofs of Boudot [4] and the efficient proofs for the product of two safe primes proposed by Camenisch and Michels [9].",

Further, we extend the test to multivariate settings and provide details on how to efficiently and rapidly carry out such a multivariate higher-order test.

It is fair to say that group AKE is currently less well understood than the case of two-party AKE; in particular, attacks by malicious insiders --- a concern specific to the group setting --- have so far been considered only in a relatively \"ad-hoc\" fashion. The main contribution of this work is to address this deficiency by providing a formal, comprehensive model and definition of security for group AKE which automatically encompasses insider attacks. We do so by defining an appropriate ideal functionality for group AKE within the universal composability (UC) framework. As a side benefit, any protocol secure with respect to our definition is secure even when run concurrently with other protocols, and the key generated by any such protocol may be used securely in any subsequent application.In addition to proposing this definition, we show that the resulting notion of security is strictly stronger than the one proposed by Bresson, et al. (termed \"AKE-security\"), and that our definition implies all previously-suggested notions of security against insider attacks. We also show a simple technique for converting any AKE-secure protocol into one secure with respect to our definition.",

      "abstract": "Software attestation has become a popular and challenging research topic at many established security conferences with an expected strong impact in practice. It aims at verifying the software integrity of (typically) resource-constrained embedded devices. However, for practical reasons, software attestation cannot rely on stored cryptographic secrets or dedicated trusted hardware. Instead, it exploits side-channel information, such as the time that the underlying device needs for a specific computation. As traditional cryptographic solutions and arguments are not applicable, novel approaches for the design and analysis are necessary. This is certainly one of the main reasons why the security goals, properties and underlying assumptions of existing software attestation schemes have been only vaguely discussed so far, limiting the confidence in their security claims. Thus, putting software attestation on a solid ground and having a founded approach for designing secure software attestation schemes is still an important open problem.\n We provide the first steps towards closing this gap. Our first contribution is a security framework that formally captures security goals, attacker models and various system and design parameters. Moreover, we present a generic software attestation scheme that covers most existing schemes in the literature. Finally, we analyze its security within our framework, yielding sufficient conditions for provably secure software attestation schemes. We expect that such a consolidating work allows for a meaningful security analysis of existing schemes, supports the design of secure software attestation schemes and will inspire new research in this area.",

Our main contribution is a model for accountable certificate management, where clients receive attestations confirming inclusion/removal of their certificates from the database of valid certificates. We explain why accountability depends on the inability of the third parties to create contradictory attestations. After that we define an undeniable attester as a primitive that provides efficient attestation creation, publishing and verification, so that it is intractable to create contradictory attestations. We introduce authenticated search trees and build an efficient undeniable attester upon them. The proposed system is the first accountable long-term certificate management system. Moreover, authenticated search trees can be used in many security-critical applications instead of the (sorted) hash trees to reduce trust in the authorities, without decrease in efficiency. Therefore, the undeniable attester promises looks like a very useful cryptographic primitive with a wide range of applications.",

      "abstract": "Buffer overflow attacks are known to be the most common type of attacks that allow attackers to hijack a remote system by sending a specially crafted packet to a vulnerable network application running on it. A comprehensive defense strategy against such attacks should include (1) an attack detection component that determines the fact that a program is compromised and prevents the attack from further propagation, (2) an attack identification component that identifies attack packets so that one can block such packets in the future, and (3) an attack repair component that restores the compromised application’s state to that before the attack and allows it to continue running normally. Over the last decade, a significant amount of research has been vested in the systems that can detect buffer overflow attacks either statically at compile time or dynamically at run time. However, not much effort is spent on automated attack packet identification or attack repair. In this paper we present a unified solution to the three problems mentioned above. We implemented this solution as a GCC compiler extension called DIRA that transforms a program’s source code so that the resulting program can automatically detect any buffer overflow attack against it, repair the memory damage left by the attack, and identify the actual attack packet(s). We used DIRA to compile several network applications with known vulnerabilities and tested DIRA’s effectiveness by attacking the transformed programs with publicly available exploit code. The DIRA-compiled programs were always able to detect the attacks, identify the attack packets and most often repair themselves to continue normal execution. The average run-time performance overhead for attack detection and attack repair/identification is 4% and 25% respectively.",

      "abstract": "We show how to obfuscate a large and expressive class of programs, which we call compute-and-compare programs, under the learning-with-errors (LWE) assumption. Each such program CC[f,y] is parametrized by an arbitrary polynomial-time computable function f along with a target value y and we define CC[f,y](x) to output 1 if f(x)=y and 0 otherwise. In other words, the program performs an arbitrary {computation} f and then compares its output against a target y. Our obfuscator satisfies distributional virtual-black-box security, which guarantees that the obfuscated program does not reveal any partial information about the function f or the target value y, as long as they are chosen from some distribution where y has sufficient pseudo-entropy given f. We also extend our result to multi-bit compute-and-compare programs MBCC[f,y,z](x) which output a message z if f(x)=y.Compute-and-compare programs are powerful enough to capture many interesting obfuscation tasks as special cases. This includes obfuscating {conjunctions, and therefore we improve on the prior work of Brakerski et al. (ITCS 16) which constructed a conjunction obfuscator under a non-standard entropic ring-LWE assumption, while here we obfuscate a significantly broader class of programs under standard LWE. We show that our obfuscator has several interesting applications. For example, we can take any encryption scheme and publish an obfuscated plaintext equality tester that allows users to check whether a ciphertext decrypts to some target value y; as long as y has sufficient pseudo-entropy this will not harm semantic security. We can also use our obfuscator to generically upgrade attribute-based encryption to predicate encryption with one-sided attribute-hiding security, and to upgrade witness encryption to indistinguishability obfuscation which is secure for all null circuits. Furthermore, we show that our obfuscator gives new circular-security counter-examples for public-key bit encryption and for unbounded length key cycles.Our result uses the graph-induced multi-linear maps of Gentry, Gorbunov and Halevi (TCC 15), but only in a carefully restricted manner which is provably secure under LWE. Our technique is inspired by ideas introduced in a recent work of Goyal, Koppula and Waters (EUROCRYPT 17) in a seemingly unrelated context.",

Since the work of Bellare and Namprempre (2000) and then Krawczyk (2001), the conventional wisdom has become that there are three forms of generic composition, with Encrypt-then-MAC the only one that generically works. However, many caveats to this understanding have surfaced over the years. Here we explore this issue further, showing how this understanding oversimplifies the situation because it ignores the results’ sensitivity to definitional choices. When encryption is formalized differently, making it either IV-based or nonce-based, rather than probabilistic, and when the AE goal is likewise changed to take in a nonce, qualitatively different results emerge. We explore these alternatives versions of the generic-composition story. We also evidence the overreaching understanding of prior generic-composition results by pointing out that the Encrypt-then-MAC mechanism of ISO 19772 is completely wrong.",

Instead, our scheme involves manipulation of ciphertexts for which the underlying private key is shared by participants in the computation. The benefits of this protocol include a high degree of conceptual and structural simplicity, low message complexity, and substantial flexibility with respect to input and output value formats. We refer to this new approach as mix and match. \n \nWhile the atomic operations in mix and match are logical operations, rather than full field operations as in previous approaches, the techniques we introduce are nonetheless highly practical for computations involving intensive bitwise manipulation. One application for which mix and match is particularly well suited is that of sealed-bid auctions. Thus, as another contribution in this paper, we present a practical, mix-and-match-based auction protocol that is fully private and non-interactive and may be readily adapted to a wide range of auction strategies.",

      "abstract": "Hybrid mobile applications (apps) combine the features of Web applications and \"native\" mobile apps. Like Web applications, they are implemented in portable, platform-independent languages such as HTML and JavaScript. Like native apps, they have direct access to local device resources-file system, location, camera, contacts, etc. Hybrid apps are typically developed using hybrid application frameworks such as PhoneGap. The purpose of the framework is twofold. First, it provides an embedded Web browser (for example, WebView on Android) that executes the app's Web code. Second, it supplies \"bridges\" that allow Web code to escape the browser and access local resources on the device. We analyze the software stack created by hybrid frameworks and demonstrate that it does not properly compose the access-control policies governing Web code and local code, respectively. Web code is governed by the same origin policy, whereas local code is governed by the access-control policy of the operating system (for example, user-granted permissions in Android). The bridges added by the framework to the browser have the same local access rights as the entire application, but are not correctly protected by the same origin policy. This opens the door to fracking attacks, which allow foreign-origin Web content included into a hybrid app (e.g., ads confined in iframes) to drill through the layers and directly access device resources. Fracking vulnerabilities are generic: they affect all hybrid frameworks, all embedded Web browsers, all bridge mechanisms, and all platforms on which these frameworks are deployed. We study the prevalence of fracking vulnerabilities in free Android apps based on the PhoneGap framework. Each vulnerability exposes sensitive local resources-the ability to read and write contacts list, local files, etc.-to dozens of potentially malicious Web domains. We also analyze the defenses deployed by hybrid frameworks to prevent resource access by foreign-origin Web content and explain why they are ineffectual. We then present NoFrak, a capability-based defense against fracking attacks. NoFrak is platform-independent, compatible with any framework and embedded browser, requires no changes to the code of the existing hybrid apps, and does not break their advertising-supported business model.",

Furthermore, our solutions are non-interactive and have the structure of reusable garbled RAM programs, addressing an open question of Lu and Ostrovsky (Eurocrypt 2013). We also construct schemes for an augmented variant of the above scenario, where the client can initially outsource a large private and persistent database to the server, and later outsource arbitrary program executions with read/write access to this database. Our solutions are built from non-reusable garbled RAM in conjunction with new types of reusable garbled circuits that are more efficient than prior solutions but only satisfy weaker security. For the basic setting without a persistent database, we can instantiate the required type of reusable garbled circuits from indistinguishability obfuscation or from functional encryption for circuits as a black-box. For the more complex setting with a persistent database, we can instantiate the required type of reusable garbled circuits using stronger notions of obfuscation. Our basic solution also requires the client to perform a one-time pre-processing step to garble a program at the cost of its RAM run-time, and we can avoid this cost using stronger notions of obfuscation. It remains an open problem to instantiate these new types of reusable garbled circuits under weaker assumptions, possibly avoiding obfuscation altogether. We show several simple extensions of our results and techniques to achieve: efficiency proportional to the input-specific RAM run-time, verifiability of outsourced RAM computation, functional encryption for RAMs, and a candidate obfuscation for RAMs.",

The objective is to minimize the sum of facility and assignment costs. We prove that the competitive ratio for Online Facility Location is Θ(log n/log log n). On the negative side, we show that no randomized algorithm can achieve a competitive ratio better than Ω(log n/log log n) against an oblivious adversary even if the demands lie on a line segment. On the positive side, we present a deterministic algorithm achieving a competitive ratio of O(log n/log log n). The analysis is based on a hierarchical decomposition of the optimal facility locations such that each component either is relatively well-separated or has a relatively large diameter, and a potential function argument which distinguishes between the two kinds of components.",

We also show that H. Seki et al.'s idea combined with our related key differential characteristic can be applied to attack 31 rounds of GOST . Lastly, we propose a related key differential attack on full-round GOST.

      "abstract": "We provide a largely automated system for verifying ClarkWilson interprocess information-flow integrity. Information-flow integrity properties are essential to isolate trusted processes from untrusted ones, but system misconfiguration can easily create insecure dependences. For example, an untrusted user process may be able to write to sshd config via a cron script. A useful notion of integrity is the Clark-Wilson integrity model [7], which allows trusted processes to accept necessary untrusted inputs (e.g., network data or print jobs) via filtering interfaces that sanitize the data. However, Clark-Wilson has the requirement that programs undergo formal semantic verification; in practice, this kind of burden has meant that no information-flow integrity property is verified on most widely-used systems. We define a weaker version of Clark-Wilson integrity, called CW-Lite, which has the same interprocess information-flow guarantees, but which requires less filtering, only small changes to existing applications, and which we can check using automated tools. We modify the SELinux user library and kernel module in order to support CW-Lite integrity verification and develop new software tools to aid developers in finding and enabling filtering interfaces. Using our toolset, we found and fixed several integrity-violating configuration errors in the default SELinux policies for OpenSSH and vsftpd.",

This new method is useful for attacking ciphers using simple algebraic functions (in particular quadratic functions) as S-boxes. Also, ciphers of low non-linear order are vulnerable to attacks based on higher order differentials. Recently, Knudsen and Nyberg presented a 6-round prototype cipher which is provably secure against ordinary differential cryptanalysis. We show how to attack the cipher by using higher order differentials and a variant of the cipher by the interpolation attack. It is possible to successfully cryptanalyse up to 32 rounds of the variant using about 232 chosen plaintexts with a running time less than 264. Using higher order differentials, a new design concept for block ciphers by Kiefer is also shown to be insecure. Rijmen et al presented a design strategy for block ciphers and the cipher SHARK. We show that there exist ciphers constructed according to this design strategy which can be broken faster than claimed. In particular, we cryptanalyse 5 rounds of a variant of SHARK, which deviates only slightly from the proposed SHARK.",

Our main application is the black-box construction of chosen-ciphertext secure public-key encryption (CCA-secure PKE). Namely, we give a black-box construction of CCA-Secure PKE from ATDFs, as well as a construction of ATDFs from correlation-secure TDFs introduced by Rosen and Segev (TCC ’09). Moreover, by an extension of a recent result of Vahlis (TCC ’10), we show that ATDFs are strictly weaker than the latter (in a black-box sense). Thus, adaptivity appears to be the weakest condition on a TDF currently known to yield the first implication. \n \nWe also give a black-box construction of CCA-secure PKE from a natural extension of ATDFs we call tag-based ATDFs that, when applied to our constructions of the latter from either correlation-secure TDFs, or lossy TDFs introduced by Peikert and Waters (STOC ’08), yield precisely the CCA-secure PKE schemes in these works. This helps to unify and clarify their schemes. Finally, we show how to realize tag-based ATDFs from an assumption on RSA inversion not known to yield correlation-secure TDFs.",

This problem motivated Even and Mansour to develop their scheme in 1991, but its exact security remained open for more than 20 years in the sense that the lower bound proof considered known plaintexts, whereas the best published attack (which was based on differential cryptanalysis) required chosen plaintexts. In this paper we solve this open problem by describing the new Slidex attack which matches the T=Ω(2n/D) lower bound on the time T for any number of known plaintexts D. Once we obtain this tight bound, we can show that the original two-key Even-Mansour scheme is not minimal in the sense that it can be simplified into a single key scheme with half as many key bits which provides exactly the same security, and which can be argued to be the simplest conceivable provably secure block cipher. We then show that there can be no comparable lower bound on the memory requirements of such attacks, by developing a new memoryless attack which can be applied with the same time complexity but only in the special case of D=2n/2. In the last part of the paper we analyze the security of several other variants of the Even-Mansour scheme, showing that some of them provide the same level of security while in others the lower bound proof fails for very delicate reasons.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we study the existence of multicollisions in iterated hash functions. We show that finding multicollisions, i.e. r-tuples of messages that all hash to the same value, is not much harder than finding ordinary collisions, i.e. pairs of messages, even for extremely large values of r. More precisely, the ratio of the complexities of the attacks is approximately equal to the logarithm of r. Then, using large multicollisions as a tool, we solve a long standing open problem and prove that concatenating the results of several iterated hash functions in order to build a larger one does not yield a secure construction. We also discuss the potential impact of our attack on several published schemes. Quite surprisingly, for subtle reasons, the schemes we study happen to be immune to our attack.",

Many basic cryptographic functions like encryption, signing, hashing, etc. can be realized using code theoretic concepts. In this paper we briefly show how to correct errors in transmitted data by employing Goppa codes and describe possible applications to public key cryptography. The main focus of this paper is to provide detailed insight into the state of art of cryptanalysis of the McEliece cryptosystem and the effect on different cryptographic applications. We conclude, that for code based cryptography a public key of 88KB offers sufficient security for encryption, while we need a public key of at least 597KB for secure signing.",

Unfortunately, current fuzzing tools suffer from a number of limitations, and, in particular, they provide little support for the fuzzing of stateful protocols. \n \nIn this paper, we present SNOOZE, a tool for building flexible, security-oriented, network protocol fuzzers. SNOOZE implements a stateful fuzzing approach that can be used to effectively identify security flaws in network protocol implementations. SNOOZE allows a tester to describe the stateful operation of a protocol and the messages that need to be generated in each state. In addition, SNOOZE provides attack-specific fuzzing primitives that allow a tester to focus on specific vulnerability classes. We used an initial prototype of the SNOOZE tool to test programs that implement the SIP protocol, with promising results. SNOOZE supported the creation of sophisticated fuzzing scenarios that were able to expose real-world bugs in the programs analyzed.",

Our work takes the collective perspective, and focuses on detecting spam campaigns that manipulate multiple accounts to spread spam on Twitter. Complementary to conventional detection methods, our work brings efficiency and robustness.

A signature is a non-interactive zero-knowledge proof of x, that incorporates a message to be signed. For this proof, we leverage recent progress of Giacomelli et al. (USENIX'16) in constructing an efficient Σ-protocol for statements over general circuits. We improve this Σ-protocol to reduce proof sizes by a factor of two, at no additional computational cost. While this is of independent interest as it yields more compact proofs for any circuit, it also decreases our signature sizes.\n We consider two possibilities to make the proof non-interactive: the Fiat-Shamir transform and Unruh's transform (EUROCRYPT'12, '15,'16). The former has smaller signatures, while the latter has a security analysis in the quantum-accessible random oracle model. By customizing Unruh's transform to our application, the overhead is reduced to 1.6x when compared to the Fiat-Shamir transform, which does not have a rigorous post-quantum security analysis.\n We implement and benchmark both approaches and explore the possible choice of f, taking advantage of the recent trend to strive for practical symmetric ciphers with a particularly low number of multiplications and end up using Low MC (EUROCRYPT'15).",

      "abstract": "Motivated by the security of the nonlinear filter generator, the concept of correlation was previously extended to the conditional correlation, that studied the linear correlation of the inputs conditioned on a given (short) output pattern of some specific nonlinear function. Based on the conditional correlations, conditional correlation attacks were shown to be successful and efficient against the nonlinear filter generator. In this paper, we further generalize the concept of conditional correlations by assigning it with a different meaning, i.e. the correlation of the output of an arbitrary function conditioned on the unknown (partial) input which is uniformly distributed. Based on this generalized conditional correlation, a general statistical model is studied for dedicated key-recovery distinguishers. It is shown that the generalized conditional correlation is no smaller than the unconditional correlation. Consequently, our distinguisher improves on the traditional one (in the worst case it degrades into the traditional one). In particular, the distinguisher may be successful even if no ordinary correlation exists. As an application, a conditional correlation attack is developed and optimized against Bluetooth two-level E0. The attack is based on a recently detected flaw in the resynchronization of E0, as well as the investigation of conditional correlations in the Finite State Machine (FSM) governing the keystream output of E0. Our best attack finds the original encryption key for two-level E0 using the first 24 bits of 223.8 frames and with 238 computations. This is clearly the fastest and only practical known-plaintext attack on Bluetooth encryption compared with all existing attacks. Current experiments confirm our analysis.",

We show that if R is an appropriately chosen ring of modular polynomials and X is the subset of polynomials with small coefficients, then the compact knapsack problem is as hard to solve on the average as the worst case instance of approximating the covering radius (or the length of the shortest vector, or various other well known lattice problems) of any cyclic lattice within a polynomial factor.

As a result, future DNS queries are resolved by a DNS server of the attacker's choice. The attacker can direct the victim's Internet traffic and point the victim to the attacker's own web sites regardless of what domain the victim thinks he is actually going to, potentially leading to the compromise of the victim's credentials. The same attack methodology can be used to make other changes to the router, like replacing its firmware. Routers could then host malicious web pages or engage in click fraud. Since the attack is mounted through viewing a web page, it does not require the attacker to have any physical proximity to the victim nor does it require the explicit download of traditional malicious software. The attack works under the reasonable assumption that the victim has not changed the default management password on their broadband router.",

This is crucial for the protection of FPGA applications against illegal copying and distribution.

In this paper we present for the first time efficient implementations of fuzzy extractors on FPGAs where the efficiency is measured in terms of required hardware resources. This fills the gap of the missing building block for a full FPGA IP protection solution.

One of the most promising algorithms is the code-based scheme called QC-MDPC, which has excellent performance and a small public key size. In this work we present a very efficient key recovery attack on the QC-MDPC scheme using the fact that decryption uses an iterative decoding step and this can fail with some small probability. We identify a dependence between the secret key and the failure in decoding. This can be used to build what we refer to as a distance spectrum for the secret key, which is the set of all distances between any two ones in the secret key. In a reconstruction step we then determine the secret key from the distance spectrum. The attack has been implemented and tested on a proposed instance of QC-MDPC for 80 bit security. It successfully recovers the secret key in minutes.",

      "abstract": "Abstract : Tor is a distributed onion-routing network used for achieving anonymity and resisting censorship online. Because of Tor's growing popularity, it is attracting increasingly larger threats against which it was not securely designed. In this paper we present the Sniper Attack, an extremely low cost but highly destructive denial of service attack against Tor that an adversary may use to anonymously disable arbitrary Tor relays. The attack utilizes valid protocol messages to boundlessly consume memory by exploiting Tor's end-to-end reliable data transport. We design and evaluate a prototype of the attack to show its feasibility and efficiency: our experiments show that an adversary may consume a victim relay's memory by as much as 2187 KiB/s while using at most only 92 KiB/s of upstream bandwidth. We extend our experimental results to estimate the threat against the live Tor network and find that a strategic adversary could disable all of the top 20 exit relays in only 29 minutes, thereby reducing Tor's bandwidth capacity by 35 percent. We also show how the attack enables the deanonymization of hidden services through selective denial of service by forcing them to choose guard nodes in control of the adversary. Finally, we discuss defenses against the Sniper Attack that provably render the attack ineffective, and suggest defenses against deanonymization by denial-of-service attacks in general that significantly mitigate the threat.",

      "abstract": "Standard security notions for encryption schemes do not guarantee any security if the encrypted messages depend on the secret key. Yet it is exactly the stronger notion of security in the presence of key-dependent messages (KDM security) that is required in a number of applications: most prominently, KDM security plays an important role in analyzing cryptographic multi-party protocols in a formal calculus. But although often assumed, the mere existence of KDM secure schemes is an open problem. The only previously known construction was proven secure in the random oracle model. \n \nWe present symmetric encryption schemes that are KDM secure in the standard model (i.e., without random oracles). The price we pay is that we achieve only a relaxed (but still useful) notion of key-dependent message security. Our work answers (at least partially) an open problem posed by Black, Rogaway, and Shrimpton. More concretely, our contributions are as follows: 1. We present a (stateless) symmetric encryption scheme that is information-theoretically secure in face of a bounded number and length of encryptions for which the messages depend in an arbitrary way on the secret key. 2. We present a stateful symmetric encryption scheme that is computationally secure in face of an arbitrary number of encryptions for which the messages depend only on the respective current secret state/key of the scheme. The underlying computational assumption is minimal: we assume the existence of one-way functions. 3. We give evidence that the only previously known KDM secure encryption scheme cannot be proven secure in the standard model (i.e., without random oracles).",

With regard to these criteria an optimum class of functions is considered. These functions simultaneously have maximum distance to affine functions and maximum distance to linear structures, as well as minimum correlation to affine functions. The functions with these properties are proved to coincide with certain functions known in combinatorial theory, where they are called bent functions.

      "abstract": "A central line of research in the area of PCPs is devoted to constructing short PCPs. In this paper, we show that if we allow an additional interactive verification phase, with very low communication complexity, then for some NP languages, one can construct PCPs that are significantly shorter than the known PCPs (without the additional interactive phase) for these languages. We give many cryptographical applications and motivations for our results and for the study of the new model in general. \n \nMore specifically, we study a new model of proofs: interactive-PCP . Roughly speaking, an interactive-PCP (say, for the membership xi¾? L) is a proof-string that can be verified by reading only one of its bits, with the help of an interactive-proof with very small communication complexity. We show that for membership in some NP languages L, there are interactive-PCPs that are significantly shorter than the known (non-interactive) PCPs for these languages. \n \nOur main result is that for any constant depth Boolean formula i¾?(z 1 ,...,z k ) of size n(over the gates i¾? , i¾? , i¾? , ¬), a prover, Alice, can publish a proof-string for the satisfiability of i¾?, where the size of the proof-string is poly(k). Later on, any user who wishes to verify the published proof-string needs to interact with Alice via a short interactive protocol of communication complexity poly(logn), while accessing the proof-string at a single location. \n \nNote that the size of the published proof-string is poly(k), rather than poly(n), i.e., the size is polynomial in the size of the witness, rather than polynomial in the size of the instance. This compares to the known (non-interactive) PCPs that are of size polynomial in the size of the instance. By reductions, this result extends to many other central NP languages (e.g., SAT, k-clique, Vertex-Cover, etc.). \n \nMore generally, we show that the satisfiability of $\\bigwedge_{i=1}^n[\\Phi_i(z_1,\\ldots,z_k) =0]$, where each i¾? i (z 1 ,...,z k ) is an arithmetic formula of size n(say, over $\\mathbb{GF}[2]$) that computes a polynomial of degree d, can be proved by a published proof-string of size poly(k,d). Later on, any user who wishes to verify the published proof-string needs to interact with the prover via an interactive protocol of communication complexity poly(d,logn), while accessing the proof-string at a single location. \n \nWe give many applications and motivations for our results and for the study of the notion of interactive PCP in general. In particular, we have the following applications: \n \n Succinct zero knowledge proofs: We show that any interactive PCP, with certain properties, can be converted into a zero-knowledge interactive proof. We use this to construct zero-knowledge proofs of communication complexity polynomial in the size of the witness, rather than polynomial in the size of the instance, for many NP languages. \n \n Succinct probabilistically checkable arguments: In a subsequent paper, we study the new notion of probabilistically checkable argument, and show that any interactive PCP, with certain properties, translates into a probabilistically checkable argument [18]. We use this to construct probabilistically checkable arguments of size polynomial in the size of the witness, rather than polynomial in the size of the instance, for many NP languages. \n \n Commit-Reveal schemes: We show that Alice can commit to a string wof kbits, by a message of size poly(k), and later on, for any predicate i¾?of size n, whose satisfiability can be proved by an efficient enough interactive PCP with certain properties, Alice can prove the statement i¾?(w) = 1, by a zero-knowledge interactive proof with communication complexity poly(logn). (Surprisingly, the communication complexity may be significantly smaller than kand n).",

Furthermore, the previously proposed schemes satisfy an important property, the backward unlinkability. It means that even after a member is revoked, signatures produced by the member before the revocation remain anonymous. This property is needed in case a member leaves voluntarily or in case of a stolen key. In this paper an improved scheme is proposed, where the group signatures are shorter. This is achieved using a different assumption, DLDH assumption, and improving zero-knowledge proofs in the group signatures. The length of the proposed group signatures is about 53% of that of the previous ones.",

The principle is to randomly split every sensitive intermediate variable occurring in the computation into d + 1 shares, where d is called the masking order and plays the role of a security parameter. Although widely used in practice, masking is often considered as an empirical solution and its effectiveness is rarely proved. In this paper, we provide a formal security proof for masked implementations of block ciphers. Specifically, we prove that the information gained by observing the leakage from one execution can be made negligible (in the masking order). To obtain this bound, we assume that every elementary calculation in the implementation leaks a noisy function of its input, where the amount of noise can be chosen by the designer (yet linearly bounded). We further assume the existence of a leak-free component that can refresh the masks of shared variables. Our work can be viewed as an extension of the seminal work of Chari et al.published at CRYPTO in 1999 on the soundness of combining masking with noise to thwart side-channel attacks.",

      "abstract": "This paper introduces QARMA, a new family of lightweight tweakable block ciphers targeted at applications such as memory encryption, the generation of very short tags for hardware-assisted prevention of software exploitation, and the construction of keyed hash functions. QARMA is inspired by reflection ciphers such as PRINCE, to which it adds a tweaking input, and MANTIS. However, QARMA differs from previous reflector constructions in that it is a three-round Even-Mansour scheme instead of a FX-construction, and its middle permutation is non-involutory and keyed . We introduce and analyse a family of Almost MDS matrices defined over a ring with zero divisors that allows us to encode rotations in its operation while maintaining the minimal latency associated to {0, 1}-matrices. The purpose of all these design choices is to harden the cipher against various classes of attacks. We also describe new S-Box search heuristics aimed at minimising the critical path. QARMA exists in 64- and 128-bit block sizes, where block and tweak size are equal, and keys are twice as long as the blocks. We argue that QARMA provides sufficient security margins within the constraints determined by the mentioned applications, while still achieving best-in-class latency. Implementation results on a state-of-the art manufacturing process are reported. Finally, we propose a technique to extend the length of the tweak by using, for instance, a universal hash function, which can also be used to strengthen the security of QARMA.",

      "abstract": "Large scale data processing brings new challenges to the design of privacy-preserving protocols: how to meet the increasing requirements of speed and throughput of modern applications, and how to scale up smoothly when data being protected is big. Efficiency and scalability become critical criteria for privacy preserving protocols in the age of Big Data. In this paper, we present a new Private Set Intersection (PSI) protocol that is extremely efficient and highly scalable compared with existing protocols. The protocol is based on a novel approach that we call oblivious Bloom intersection. It has linear complexity and relies mostly on efficient symmetric key operations. It has high scalability due to the fact that most operations can be parallelized easily. The protocol has two versions: a basic protocol and an enhanced protocol, the security of the two variants is analyzed and proved in the semi-honest model and the malicious model respectively. A prototype of the basic protocol has been built. We report the result of performance evaluation and compare it against the two previously fastest PSI protocols. Our protocol is orders of magnitude faster than these two protocols. To compute the intersection of two million-element sets, our protocol needs only 41 seconds (80-bit security) and 339 seconds (256-bit security) on moderate hardware in parallel mode.",

It has proved useful in the design of numerous privacy-enhancing protocols, in order to handle revocation or simply prove set membership. In the lattice setting, currently known instantiations of the primitive are based on Merkle trees, which do not interact well with zero-knowledge proofs. In order to efficiently prove the membership of some element in a zero-knowledge manner, the prover has to demonstrate knowledge of a hash chain without revealing it, which is not known to be efficiently possible under well-studied hardness assumptions. In this paper, we provide an efficient method of proving such statements using involved extensions of Stern's protocol. Under the Small Integer Solution assumption, we provide zero-knowledge arguments showing possession of a hash chain. As an application, we describe new lattice-based group and ring signatures in the random oracle model. In particular, we obtain: i The first lattice-based ring signatures with logarithmic size in the cardinality of the ring; ii The first lattice-based group signature that does not require any GPV trapdoor and thus allows for a much more efficient choice of parameters.",

Until recently there was a sizable polynomial gap between the most efficient noninteractive proofs for NP based on general complexity assumptions [11] versus those based on specific algebraic assumptions [7]. Recently, this gap was reduced to a polylogarithmic factor [17]; we further reduce the gap to a constant factor. Our proof system relies on the existence of one-way permutations (or trapdoor permutations for bounded provers). Our protocol is stated in the hidden bit model introduced by Feige et al. [11]. We show how to prove that an n -gate circuit is satisfiable, with error probability 1/nO(1) , using only O(n lg n) random committed bits. For this error probability, this result matches to within a constant factor the number of committed bits required by the most efficient known interactive proof systems.",

      "abstract": "Key-dependent message (KDM) secure encryption schemes provide secrecy even when the attacker sees encryptions of messages related to the secret-key sk. Namely, the scheme should remain secure even when messages of the form f(sk) are encrypted, where f is taken from some function class $\\mathcal{F}$. A KDM amplification procedure takes an encryption scheme which satisfies $\\mathcal{F}$-KDM security, and boosts it into a $\\mathcal{G}$-KDM secure scheme, where the function class $\\mathcal{G}$ should be richer than $\\mathcal{F}$. It was recently shown by Brakerski et al. (TCC 2011) and Barak et al. (EUROCRYPT 2010) that a strong form of amplification is possible, provided that the underlying encryption scheme satisfies some special additional properties.In this work, we prove the first generic KDM amplification theorem which relies solely on the KDM security of the underlying scheme without making any other assumptions. Specifically, we show that an elementary form of KDM security against functions in which each output bit either copies or flips a single bit of the key (a.k.a. projections) can be amplified into KDM security with respect to any function family that can be computed in arbitrary fixed polynomial-time. Furthermore, our amplification theorem and its proof are insensitive to the exact setting of KDM security, and they hold in the presence of multiple-keys and in the symmetric-key/public-key and the CPA/CCA cases. As a result, we can amplify the security of most known KDM constructions, including ones that could not be amplified before.Finally, we study the minimal conditions under which full-KDM security (with respect to all functions) can be achieved. We show that under strong notion of KDM security, the existence of fully homomorphic encryption which allows to encrypt the secret-key (i.e., “cyclic-secure”) is not only sufficient for full-KDM security, as shown by Barak et al., but also necessary. On the other hand, we observe that for standard KDM security, this condition can be relaxed by adopting Gentry’s bootstrapping technique (STOC 2009) to the KDM setting.",

Using the equivalence between the two LTSs, we identify a class of communicating automata that exactly correspond to the projected local types. We exhibit an algorithm to synthesise a global type from a collection of communicating automata.

      "abstract": "We revisit the question of constructing secure general-purpose indistinguishability obfuscation, with a security reduction based on explicit computational assumptions over multilinear maps. Previous to our work, such reductions were only known to exist based on meta-assumptions and/or ad-hoc assumptions: In the original constructive work of Garg et al. (FOCS 2013), the underlying explicit computational assumption encapsulated an exponential family of assumptions for each pair of circuits to be obfuscated. In the more recent work of Pass et al. (Crypto 2014), the underlying assumption is a meta-assumption that also encapsulates an exponential family of assumptions, and this meta-assumption is invoked in a manner that captures the specific pair of circuits to be obfuscated. The assumptions underlying both these works substantially capture (either explicitly or implicitly) the actual structure of the obfuscation mechanism itself. In our work, we provide the first construction of general-purpose indistinguishability obfuscation proven secure via a reduction to a natural computational assumption over multilinear maps, namely, the Multilinear Subgroup Elimination Assumption. This assumption does not depend on the circuits to be obfuscated (except for its size), and does not correspond to the underlying structure of our obfuscator. The technical heart of our paper is our reduction, which gives a new way to argue about the security of indistinguishability obfuscation.",

There have been countless cases where simple mistakes by developers resulted in memory corruption vulnerabilities and consequently security exploits. While there have been tremendous research efforts to mitigate these vulnerabilities, useafter-free still remains one of the most critical and popular attack vectors because existing proposals have not adequately addressed the challenging program analysis and runtime performance issues. In this paper we present DANGNULL, a system that detects temporal memory safety violations—in particular, use-after-free and double-free—during runtime. DANGNULL relies on the key observation that the root cause of these violations is that pointers are not nullified after the target object is freed. Based on this observation, DANGNULL automatically traces the object’s relationships via pointers and automatically nullifies all pointers when the target object is freed. DANGNULL offers several benefits. First, DANGNULL addresses the root cause of temporal memory safety violations. It does not rely on the side effects of violations, which can vary and may be masked by attacks. Thus, DANGNULL is effective against even the most sophisticated exploitation techniques. Second, DANGNULL checks object relationship information using runtime object range analysis on pointers, and thus is able to keep track of pointer semantics more robustly even in complex and large scale software. Lastly, DANGNULL does not require numerous explicit sanity checks on memory accesses because it can detect a violation with implicit exception handling, and thus its detection capabilities only incur moderate performance overhead.",

      "abstract": "We define and propose an efficient and provably secure construction of blind signatures with attributes. Prior notions of blind signatures did not yield themselves to the construction of anonymous credential systems, not even if we drop the unlinkability requirement of anonymous credentials. Our new notion in contrast is a convenient building block for anonymous credential systems. The construction we propose is efficient: it requires just a few exponentiations in a prime-order group in which the decisional Diffie-Hellman problem is hard. Thus, for the first time, we give a provably secure construction of anonymous credentials that can work in the elliptic group setting without bilinear pairings and is based on the DDH assumption. In contrast, prior provably secure constructions were based on the RSA group or on groups with pairings, which made them prohibitively inefficient for mobile devices, RFIDs and smartcards. The only prior efficient construction that could work in such elliptic curve groups, due to Brands, does not have a proof of security.",

Often, counting classes, probabilistic classes, and intersection classes lack such enumerations. Concentrating on the counting class UP, we show that there are relativizations for which UPA has no complete languages and other relativizations for which PB ≠ UPB ≠ NPB and UPB has complete languages. Among other results we show that P ≠ UP if and only if there exists a set S in P of Boolean formulas with at most one satisfying assignment such that S ∩ SAT is not in P. P ≠ UP ∩ coUP if and only if there exists a set S in P of uniquely satisfiable Boolean formulas such that no polynomial-time machine can compute the solutions for the formulas in S. If UP has complete languages then there exists a set R in P of Boolean formulas with at most one satisfying assignment so that SAT ∩ R is complete for UP. Finally, we indicate the wide applicability of our techniques to counting and probabilistic classes by using them to examine the probabilistic class BPP. There is a relativized world where BPPA has no complete languages. If BPP has complete languages then it has a complete language of the form B ∩ MAJORITY, where B ∈ P and MAJORITY = {f | f is true for at least half of all assignments} is the canonical PP-complete set.",

      "abstract": "Many Android apps use SSL/TLS to transmit sensitive information securely. However, developers often provide their own implementation of the standard SSL/TLS certificate validation process. Unfortunately, many such custom implementations have subtle bugs, have built-in exceptions for self-signed certificates, or blindly assert all certificates are valid, leaving many Android apps vulnerable to SSL/TLS Man-in-the-Middle attacks. In this paper, we present SMV-HUNTER, a system for the automatic, large-scale identification of such vulnerabilities that combines both static and dynamic analysis. The static component detects when a custom validation procedure has been given, thereby identifying potentially vulnerable apps, and extracts information used to guide the dynamic analysis, which then uses user interface enumeration and automation techniques to trigger the potentially vulnerable code under an active Man-in-the-Middle attack. We have implemented SMV-HUNTER and evaluated it on 23,418 apps downloaded from the Google Play market, of which 1,453 apps were identified as being potentially vulnerable by static analysis, with an average overhead of approximately 4 seconds per app, running on 16 threads in parallel. Among these potentially vulnerable apps, 726 were confirmed vulnerable using our dynamic analysis, with an average overhead of about 44 seconds per app, running on 8 emulators in parallel.",

This is easily seento be the case inclassical algorithms such as DES or RSA. \n \nHowever, for algorithms that combine boolean and arithmetic functions, such as IDEA or several of the AES candidates, two different kinds of masking have to be used. There is thus a need for a method to convert back and forth between boolean masking and arithmetic masking. \n \nA first solutionto this problem was proposed by Thomas Messerges in [15], but was unfortunately shown (see [6]) insufficient to prevent DPA. In the present paper, we present two new practical algorithms for the conversion, that are proven secure against DPA. \n \nThe first one (\"BooleanToArithmetic\") uses a constant number of elementary operations, namely 7, on the registers of the processor.

Firstly, we discuss formal and conceptual issues in the various current definitions of PUFs. As we argue, they have the effect that many PUF candidates formally meet no existing definition. Next, we present alternative definitions and a new formalism. It avoids asymptotic concepts like polynomial time, but is based on concrete time bounds and on the concept of a security experiment. The formalism splits the notion of a PUF into two new notions, Strong t-PUFs and Obfuscating t-PUFs. Then, we provide a comparative analysis between the existing definitions and our new notions, by classifying existing PUF implementations with respect to them. In this process, we use several new and unpublished machine learning results. The outcome of this comparative classification is that our definitions seem to match the current PUF landscape well, perhaps better than previous definitions. Finally, we analyze the security and practicality features of Strong and Obfuscating t-PUFs in concrete applications, obtaining further justification for the split into two notions.",

The GHASH authentication component of GCM belongs to a class of Wegman-Carter polynomial hashes that operate in the field GF(2128).

GCM uses the same block cipher key K to both encrypt data and to derive the generator H of the authentication polynomial for GHASH. In present literature, only the trivial weak key H=0 has been considered. We show that GHASH has much wider classes of weak keys in its 512 multiplicative subgroups, analyze some of their properties, and give experimental results on AES-GCM weak key search. Our attacks can be used not only to bypass message authentication with garbage but also to target specific plaintext bits if a polynomial MAC is used in conjunction with a stream cipher. These attacks can also be applied with varying efficiency to other polynomial hashes and MACs, depending on their field properties. Our findings show that especially the use of short polynomial-evaluation MACs should be avoided if the underlying field has a smooth multiplicative order.",

      "abstract": "We continue a line of research initiated in [10, 11] on privacy-preserving statistical databases. Consider a trusted server that holds a database of sensitive information. Given a query function f mapping databases to reals, the so-called true answer is the result of applying f to the database. To protect privacy, the true answer is perturbed by the addition of random noise generated according to a carefully chosen distribution, and this response, the true answer plus noise, is returned to the user. Previous work focused on the case of noisy sums, in which f = Σ i g(x i ), where x i denotes the ith row of the database and g maps database rows to [0,1]. We extend the study to general functions f, proving that privacy can be preserved by calibrating the standard deviation of the noise according to the sensitivity of the function f. Roughly speaking, this is the amount that any single argument to f can change its output. The new analysis shows that for several particular applications substantially less noise is needed than was previously understood to be the case. The first step is a very clean characterization of privacy in terms of indistinguishability of transcripts. Additionally, we obtain separation results showing the increased value of interactive sanitization mechanisms over non-interactive.",

We implement our approach in a tool called AnDarwin and evaluate it on 265,359 apps collected from 17 markets including Google Play and numerous thirdparty markets. In contrast to earlier approaches, AnDarwin has four advantages: it avoids comparing apps pairwise, thus greatly improving its scalability; it analyzes only the app code and does not rely on other information - such as the app’s market, signature, or description - thus greatly increasing its reliability; it can detect both full and partial app similarity; and it can automatically detect library code and remove it from the similarity analysis. We present two use cases for AnDarwin: finding similar apps by different developers (“clones”) and similar apps from the same developer (“rebranded”). In ten hours, AnDarwin detected at least 4,295 apps that have been the victims of cloning and 36,106 apps that are rebranded. By analyzing the clusters found by AnDarwin, we found 88 new variants of malware and identified 169 malicious apps based on differences in the requested permissions.

      "abstract": "Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is a new networking paradigm that grants a controller and its applications an omnipotent power to have holistic network visibility and flexible network programmability, thus enabling new innovations in network protocols and applications. One of the core advantages of SDN is its logically centralized control plane to provide the entire network visibility, on which many SDN applications rely. For the first time in the literature, we propose new attack vectors unique to SDN that seriously challenge this foundation. Our new attacks are somewhat similar in spirit to spoofing attacks in legacy networks (e.g., ARP poisoning attack), however with significant differences in exploiting unique vulnerabilities how current SDN operates differently from legacy networks. The successful attacks can effectively poison the network topology information, a fundamental building block for core SDN components and topology-aware SDN applications. With the poisoned network visibility, the upper-layer OpenFlow controller services/apps may be totally misled, leading to serious hijacking, denial of service or man-in-the-middle attacks. According to our study, all current major SDN controllers we find in the market (e.g., Floodlight, OpenDaylight, Beacon, and POX) are affected, i.e., they are subject to the Network Topology Poisoning Attacks. We then investigate the mitigation methods against the Network Topology Poisoning Attacks and present TopoGuard, a new security extension to SDN controllers, which provides automatic and real-time detection of Network Topology Poisoning Attacks. Our evaluation on a prototype implementation of TopoGuard in the Floodlight controller shows that the defense solution can effectively secure network topology while introducing only a minor impact on normal operations of OpenFlow controllers.",

We present a novel methodology to reduce this verification problem into a set of Boolean satisfiability problems, which can be efficiently solved by leveraging recent advances in SAT solving. To show the effectiveness of our methodology, we have implemented an automatic verification tool, named Sleuth, as an advanced analysis pass in the back-end of the LLVM compiler.

His algorithm works by traversing a so-called component tree. Two new related results are provided here. First, and most importantly, Thorup's approach is generalized from undirected to directed networks. The resulting time bound, O(n + m log w), is the best deterministic linear-space bound known for sparse networks unless w is superpolynomial in log n. As an application, all-pairs shortest-paths problems in directed networks with n vertices, m edges, and edge weights in {-2w, . . . , 2w} can be solved in O(nm + n2 log log n) time and O(n + m) space (not counting the output space). Second, it is shown that the component tree for an undirected network can be constructed in deterministic linear time and space with a simple algorithm, to be contrasted with a complicated and impractical solution suggested by Thorup.

Our solution based on a variation of the RSA problem is more efficient than previous ones satisfying these requirements.",

For example, one intelligence agency might be willing to turn over certain documents to another such agency, but only if the second agency requests the specific documents. The problem, of course, is finding out that such documents exist when access to the database is restricted. We propose a search scheme based on Bloom filters and group ciphers such as Pohlig-Hellman encryption. A semi-trusted third party can transform one party’s search queries to a form suitable for querying the other party’s database, in such a way that neither the third party nor the database owner can see the original query. Furthermore, the encryption keys used to construct the Bloom filters are not shared with this third party. Multiple providers and queriers are supported; provision can be made for third-party “warrant servers”, as well as “censorship sets” that limit the data to be shared.",

Concurrent signatures fall just short of providing a full solution to the problem of fair exchange of signatures, but we discuss some applications in which concurrent signatures suffice.

The relaxation of security is obtained by allowing the ideal-model simulator to run in quasipolynomial (as opposed to polynomial) time. Quasipolynomial simulation suffices to ensure security for most applications of multiparty computation. Furthermore, Lindell (FOCS '03, TCC' 04) recently showed that such a protocol is impossible to obtain under the more standard definition of polynomial-time simulation by an ideal adversary. Our construction is the first such protocol under reasonably standard cryptographic assumptions (i.e., existence of a hash function collection that is collision resistent with respect to circuits of subexponential size, and existence of trapdoor permutations which are secure with respect to circuits of quasi-polynomial size). We introduce a new technique: \"protocol condensing\". That is, taking a protocol that has strong security properties but requires super-polynomial communication and computation, and then transforming it into a protocol with polynomial communication and computation, that still inherits the strong security properties of the original protocol. Our result is obtained by combining this technique with previous techniques of Canetti, Lindell, Ostrovsky, and Sahai (STOC '02) and Pass (STOC '04).",

However, current modeling of security in the presence of such set-up falls short of providing the expected security guarantees. A quintessential example of this phenomenon is the deniability concern: there exist natural protocols that meet the strongest known composable security notions, and are still vulnerable to bad interactions with rogue protocols that use the same set-up. \n \nWe extend the notion of universally composable (UC) security in a way that re-establishes its original intuitive guarantee even for protocols that use globally available set-up. The new formulation prevents bad interactions even with adaptively chosen protocols that use the same set-up. In particular, it guarantees deniability. While for protocols that use no setup the proposed requirements are the same as in traditional UC security, for protocols that use global set-up the proposed requirements are significantly stronger. In fact, realizing Zero Knowledge or commitment becomes provably impossible, even in the Common Reference String model. Still, we propose reasonable alternative set-up assumptions and protocols that allow realizing practically any cryptographic task under standard hardness assumptions even against adaptive corruptions.",

As a corollary, we get that quantum UC secure protocols for general multi-party computation can be constructed from commitments.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we study the Learning With Errors problem and its binary variant, where secrets and errors are binary or taken in a small interval. We introduce a new variant of the Blum, Kalai and Wasserman algorithm, relying on a quantization step that generalizes and fine-tunes modulus switching. In general this new technique yields a significant gain in the constant in front of the exponent in the overall complexity. We illustrate this by solving p within half a day a LWE instance with dimension n = 128, modulus $q = n^2$, Gaussian noise $\\alpha = 1/(\\sqrt{n/\\pi} \\log^2 n)$ and binary secret, using $2^{28}$ samples, while the previous best result based on BKW claims a time complexity of $2^{74}$ with $2^{60}$ samples for the same parameters. We then introduce variants of BDD, GapSVP and UniqueSVP, where the target point is required to lie in the fundamental parallelepiped, and show how the previous algorithm is able to solve these variants in subexponential time. Moreover, we also show how the previous algorithm can be used to solve the BinaryLWE problem with n samples in subexponential time $2^{(\\ln 2/2+o(1))n/\\log \\log n}$. This analysis does not require any heuristic assumption, contrary to other algebraic approaches; instead, it uses a variant of an idea by Lyubashevsky to generate many samples from a small number of samples. This makes it possible to asymptotically and heuristically break the NTRU cryptosystem in subexponential time (without contradicting its security assumption). We are also able to solve subset sum problems in subexponential time for density $o(1)$, which is of independent interest: for such density, the previous best algorithm requires exponential time. As a direct application, we can solve in subexponential time the parameters of a cryptosystem based on this problem proposed at TCC 2010.",

In particular, this is more general than the tolerance of Chow et al.'s IBE schemes (CCS '10) and Lewko et al.'s IBE schemes (TCC '11), in which the leakage is bounded by a pre-defined number of bits; yet our construction is also fully secure in the standard model based on only static assumptions, and can be easily extended to give the first hierarchical IBE with auxiliary input. \n \nFurthermore, we propose the model of continual auxiliary leakage (CAL) that can capture both memory leakage and continual leakage. The CAL model is particularly appealing since it not only gives a clean definition when there are multiple secret keys (the master secret key, the identity-based secret keys, and their refreshed versions), but also gives a generalized definition that does not assume secure erasure of secret keys after each key update. This is different from previous definitions of continual leakage (FOCS '10, TCC '11) in which the length-bounded leakage is only the secret key in the current time period. Finally, we devise an IBE scheme which is secure in this model. A major tool we use is the modified Goldreich-Levin theorem (TCC '10), which until now has only been applied in traditional public-key encryption with a single private key.",

This paper describes the design and implementation of our prototype framework, Nitro, for system call tracing and monitoring. Since Nitro is a purely VMI-based system, it remains isolated from attacks originating within the guest operating system and is not directly visible from within the guest. Nitro is extremely flexible as it supports all three system call mechanisms provided by the Intel ×86 architecture and has been proven to work in Windows, Linux, 32-bit, and 64-bit environments. The high performance of our system allows for real-time capturing and dissemination of data without hindering usability. This is supported by extensive testing with various guest operating systems. In addition, Nitro is resistant to circumvention attempts due to a construction called hardware rooting. Finally, Nitro surpasses similar systems in both performance and functionality.",

A challenge in this context is the virtualization of hardware security modules like the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) since the intended purpose of TPMs is to securely link software and the underlying hardware. Existing solutions for TPM virtualization, however, have various shortcomings that hinder the deployment to a wide range of useful scenarios. In this paper, we address these shortcomings by presenting a flexible and privacy-preserving design of a virtual TPM that in contrast to existing solutions supports different approaches for measuring the platform's state and for key generation, and uses property-based attestation mechanisms to support software updates and VM migration. Our solution improves the maintainability and applicability of hypervisors supporting hardware security modules like TPM.",

For this purpose, information extraction procedures published so far essentially combine a “leakage model” with a “distinguisher”. Fair evaluations ideally require exploiting a perfect leakage model (i.e. exactly corresponding to the true leakage distribution) with a Bayesian distinguisher. But since such perfect models are generally unknown, density estimation techniques have to be used to approximate the leakage distribution. This raises the fundamental problem that all security evaluations are potentially biased by both estimation and assumption errors. Hence, the best that we can hope is to be aware of these errors. In this paper, we provide and implement methodological tools to solve this issue. Namely, we show how sound statistical techniques allow both quantifying the leakage of a chip, and certifying that the amount of information extracted is close to the maximum value that would be obtained with a perfect model.",

We demonstrate attacks which use decryption failures to recover the private key. Such attacks work for all standard parameter sets, and one of them applies to any padding. The appropriate countermeasure is to change the parameter sets and possibly the decryption process so that decryption failures are vanishingly unlikely, and to adopt a padding scheme that prevents an attacker from directly controlling any part of the input to the encryption primitive.

However, outsourcing the data processing o the cloud poses high risks for personal privacy. The aim of this paper is to give a practical solution for this problem using homomorphic encryption. In our approach, all the computations can be performed in an untrusted cloud without requiring the decryption key or any interaction with the data owner, which preserves the privacy of genome data.MethodsWe present evaluation algorithms for secure computation of the minor allele frequencies and χ2 statistic in a genome-wide association studies setting. We also describe how to privately compute the Hamming distance and approximate Edit distance between encrypted DNA sequences. Finally, we compare performance details of using two practical homomorphic encryption schemes - the BGV scheme by Gentry, Halevi and Smart and the YASHE scheme by Bos, Lauter, Loftus and Naehrig.ResultsThe approach with the YASHE scheme analyzes data from 400 people within about 2 seconds and picks a variant associated with disease from 311 spots. For another task, using the BGV scheme, it took about 65 seconds to securely compute the approximate Edit distance for DNA sequences of size 5K and figure out the differences between them.ConclusionsThe performance numbers for BGV are better than YASHE when homomorphically evaluating deep circuits (like the Hamming distance algorithm or approximate Edit distance algorithm). On the other hand, it is more efficient to use the YASHE scheme for a low-degree computation, such as minor allele frequencies or χ2 test statistic in a case-control study.",

Besides its strong security guarantees, its simplicity and versatility make this powerful theoretical tool a promising competitive alternative to classical cryptographic schemes. \n \nIn this paper, we introduce NFLlib, an efficient and open-source C++ library dedicated to ideal lattice cryptography in the widely-spread polynomial ring $$\\mathbb Z_{p}[x]/x^n+1$$ for n a power of 2. The library combines algorithmic optimizations Chinese Remainder Theorem, optimized Number Theoretic Transform together with programming optimization techniques SSE and AVX2 specializations, C++ expression templates, etc., and will be fully available under an open source license. \n \nThe library compares very favorably to other libraries used in ideal lattice cryptography implementations namely the generic number theory libraries NTL and flint implementing polynomial arithmetic, and the optimized library for lattice homomorphic encryption HElib: restricting the library to the aforementioned polynomial ring allows to gain several orders of magnitude in efficiency.",

In this paper we focus on security models for authenticated key exchange (AKE) protocols. We observe that there are several classes of attacks on AKE protocols that lie outside the scope of the Canetti-Krawczyk model. Some of these additional attacks have already been considered by Krawczyk [12]. In an attempt to bring these attacks within the scope of the security model we extend the Canetti-Krawczyk model for AKE security by providing significantly greater powers to the adversary. Our contribution is a more compact, integrated, and comprehensive formulation of the security model. We then introduce a new AKE protocol called NAXOS and prove that it is secure against these stronger adversaries.",

We investigate whether the resulting non-interactive zero-knowledge (NIZK) proof systems also exhibit non-malleability properties that have up to now only been studied for NIZK proof systems in the common reference string model: first, we formally define simulation soundness and a weak form of simulation extraction in the random oracle model (ROM). Second, we show that in the ROM the Fiat-Shamir transform meets these properties under lenient conditions. A consequence of our result is that, in the ROM, we obtain truly efficient non malleable NIZK proof systems essentially for free. Our definitions are sufficient for instantiating the Naor-Yung paradigm for CCA2-secure encryption, as well as a generic construction for signature schemes from hard relations and simulation-extractable NIZK proof systems. These two constructions are interesting as the former preserves both the leakage resilience and key-dependent message security of the underlying CPA-secure encryption scheme, while the latter lifts the leakage resilience of the hard relation to the leakage resilience of the resulting signature scheme.",

The seminal works of Kilian '92 and Micali '94 show that such arguments can be constructed under standard cryptographic hardness assumptions with four rounds of interaction, and that they be made non-interactive in the random-oracle model. However, we currently do not have any construction of succinct non-interactive arguments (SNARGs) in the standard model with a proof of security under any simple cryptographic assumption.\n In this work, we give a broad black-box separation result, showing that black-box reductions cannot be used to prove the security of any SNARG construction based on any falsifiable cryptographic assumption. This includes essentially all common assumptions used in cryptography (one-way functions, trapdoor permutations, DDH, RSA, LWE etc.). More generally, we say that an assumption is falsifiable if it can be modeled as an interactive game between an adversary and an efficient challenger that can efficiently decide if the adversary won the game. This is similar, in spirit, to the notion of falsifiability of Naor '03, and captures the fact that we can efficiently check if an adversarial strategy breaks the assumption.\n Our separation result also extends to designated verifier SNARGs, where the verifier needs a trapdoor associated with the CRS to verify arguments, and slightly succinct SNARGs, whose size is only required to be sublinear in the statement and witness size.",

This scheme satisfies receipt-freeness under the assumption that the randomizer does not collude with a buyer and two-way untappable channel exists between voters and the randomizer. But untappable channel is hard to implement in real world and will cause inconvenience to voters although it is provided. In this paper we extend [Hirt01] such that a tamper-resistant randomizer (TRR), a secure hardware device such as smart card or Java card, replaces the role of third-party randomizer and untappable channel.

Such attacks, such as Simple Power Analysis (SPA) and Differential Power Analysis (DPA), use a statistical analysis of signal waveforms (e.g., power traces) to reduce noise and to retrieve secret information. However, the waveform data often includes displacement errors in the measurements. The use of phase components in the discrete Fourier transforms of the waveforms makes it possible to estimate the displacements between the signal waveforms with higher resolution than the sampling resolution. The accuracy of a side-channel attack can be enhanced using this high-resolution matching method. In this paper, we demonstrate the advantages of the POC-based method in comparison with conventional approaches through experimental DPA and Differential ElectroMagnetic Analysis (DEMA) against a DES software implementation on a Z80 processor.",

      "abstract": "On an elliptic curve, the degree of an isogeny corresponds essentially to the degrees of the polynomial expressions involved in its application. The multiplication–by–l map [l] has degree l2, therefore the complexity to directly evaluate [l](p) is O(l2). For a small prime l (= 2, 3) such that the additive binary representation provides no better performance, this represents the true cost of application of scalar multiplication. If an elliptic curve admits an isogeny ϕ of degree l then the costs of computing ϕ(P) should in contrast be O(l) field operations. Since we then have a product expression [l]=$\\hat{\\varphi}\\varphi$, the existence of an l-isogeny ϕ on an elliptic curve yields a theoretical improvement from O(l2) to O(l) field operations for the evaluation of [l](p) by naive application of the defining polynomials. In this work we investigate actual improvements for small l of this asymptotic complexity. For this purpose, we describe the general construction of families of curves with a suitable decomposition [l]=$\\hat{\\varphi}\\varphi$, and provide explicit examples of such a family of curves with simple decomposition for [3]. Finally we derive a new tripling algorithm to find complexity improvements to triplication on a curve in certain projective coordinate systems, then combine this new operation to non-adjacent forms for l-adic expansions in order to obtain an improved strategy for scalar multiplication on elliptic curves.",

      "abstract": "Following Gennaro, Gentry, and Parno (Cryptology ePrint Archive 2009/547), we use fully homomorphic encryption to design improved schemes for delegating computation. In such schemes, a delegator outsources the computation of a function F on many, dynamically chosen inputs xi to a worker in such a way that it is infeasible for the worker to make the delegator accept a result other than F(xi). The \"online stage\" of the Gennaro et al. scheme is very efficient: the parties exchange two messages, the delegator runs in time poly(log T), and the worker runs in time poly(T), where T is the time complexity of F. However, the \"offline stage\" (which depends on the function F but not the inputs to be delegated) is inefficient: the delegator runs in time poly(T) and generates a public key of length poly(T) that needs to be accessed by the worker during the online stage. \n \nOur first construction eliminates the large public key from the Gennaro et al. scheme. The delegator still invests poly(T) time in the offline stage, but does not need to communicate or publish anything. Our second construction reduces the work of the delegator in the offline stage to poly(log T) at the price of a 4-message (offline) interaction with a poly(T)-time worker (which need not be the same as the workers used in the online stage). Finally, we describe a \"pipelined\" implementation of the second construction that avoids the need to re-run the offline construction after errors are detected (assuming errors are not too frequent).",

In order to prevent a group of users from collectively escaping identification, collusion-secure fingerprinting codes have been proposed. In this paper, we introduce a new construction of a collusion-secure fingerprinting code which is similar to a recent construction by Tardos but achieves shorter code lengths and allows for codes over arbitrary alphabets. We present results for ‘symmetric’ coalition strategies. For binary alphabets and a false accusation probability $$\\varepsilon_1$$ , a code length of $$m\\approx \\pi^2 c_0^2\\ln\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_1}$$ symbols is provably sufficient, for large c0, to withstand collusion attacks of up to c0 colluders. This improves Tardos’ construction by a factor of 10. Furthermore, invoking the Central Limit Theorem in the case of sufficiently large c0, we show that even a code length of $$m\\approx 1/2\\pi^2 c_0^2\\ln\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_1}$$ is adequate. Assuming the restricted digit model, the code length can be further reduced by moving from a binary alphabet to a q-ary alphabet. Numerical results show that a reduction of 35% is achievable for q = 3 and 80% for q = 10.",

It is crucial that such parties can be held accountable in case they misbehave as this is a strong incentive for such parties to follow the protocol. Unfortunately, there does not exist a general and convincing definition of accountability that would allow to assess the level of accountability a protocol provides.\n In this paper, we therefore propose a new, widely applicable definition of accountability, with interpretations both in symbolic and computational models. Our definition reveals that accountability is closely related to verifiability, for which we also propose a new definition. We prove that verifiability can be interpreted as a weak form of accountability. Our findings on verifiability are of independent interest.\n As a proof of concept, we apply our definitions to the analysis of protocols for three different tasks: contract-signing, voting, and auctions. Our analysis unveils some subtleties and unexpected weaknesses, showing in one case that the protocol is unusable in practice.

Although the conventional wisdom is to build atop a (weakly) synchronous protocol such as PBFT (or a variation thereof), such protocols rely critically on network timing assumptions, and only guarantee liveness when the network behaves as expected. We argue these protocols are ill-suited for this deployment scenario. We present an alternative, HoneyBadgerBFT, the first practical asynchronous BFT protocol, which guarantees liveness without making any timing assumptions. We base our solution on a novel atomic broadcast protocol that achieves optimal asymptotic efficiency. We present an implementation and experimental results to show our system can achieve throughput of tens of thousands of transactions per second, and scales to over a hundred nodes on a wide area network. We even conduct BFT experiments over Tor, without needing to tune any parameters. Unlike the alternatives, HoneyBadgerBFT simply does not care about the underlying network.",

      "abstract": "Bitcoin is a potentially disruptive new crypto-currency based on a decentralized opensource protocol which is gradually gaining popularity. Perhaps the most important question that will affect Bitcoin’s success, is whether or not it will be able to scale to support the high volume of transactions required from a global currency system. We investigate the restrictions on the rate of transaction processing in Bitcoin as a function of both the bandwidth available to nodes and the network delay, both of which lower the efficiency of Bitcoin’s transaction processing. The security analysis done by Bitcoin’s creator Satoshi Nakamoto [12] assumes that block propagation delays are negligible compared to the time between blocks—an assumption that does not hold when the protocol is required to process transactions at high rates. We improve upon the original analysis and remove this assumption. Using our results, we are able to give bounds on the number of transactions per second the protocol can handle securely. Building on previously published measurements by Decker and Wattenhofer [5], we show these bounds are currently more restrictive by an order of magnitude than the bandwidth needed to stream all transactions. We additionally show how currently planned improvements to the protocol, namely the use of transaction hashes in blocks (instead of complete transaction records), will dramatically alleviate these restrictions. Finally, we present an easily implementable modification to the way Bitcoin constructs its main data structure, the blockchain, that immensely improves security from attackers, especially when the network operates at high rates. This improvement allows for further increases in the number of transactions processed per second. We show that with our proposed modification, significant speedups can be gained in confirmation time of transactions as well. The block generation rate can be securely increased to more than one block per second – a 600 fold speedup compared to today’s rate, while still allowing the network to processes many transactions per second.",

For example, in a May 2005 crawl of 18 million URLs, we found spyware in 13.4% of the 21,200 executables we identified. At the same time, we found scripted “drive-by download” attacks in 5.9% of the Web pages we processed. Our analysis quantifies the density of spyware, the types of of threats, and the most dangerous Web zones in which spyware is likely to be encountered. We also show the frequency with which specific spyware programs were found in the content we crawled. Finally, we measured changes in the density of spyware over time; e.g., our October 2005 crawl saw a substantial reduction in the presence of drive-by download attacks, compared with those we detected in May.",

      "abstract": "The automatic detection of software vulnerabilities is an important research problem. However, existing solutions to this problem rely on human experts to define features and often miss many vulnerabilities (i.e., incurring high false negative rate). In this paper, we initiate the study of using deep learning-based vulnerability detection to relieve human experts from the tedious and subjective task of manually defining features. Since deep learning is motivated to deal with problems that are very different from the problem of vulnerability detection, we need some guiding principles for applying deep learning to vulnerability detection. In particular, we need to find representations of software programs that are suitable for deep learning. For this purpose, we propose using code gadgets to represent programs and then transform them into vectors, where a code gadget is a number of (not necessarily consecutive) lines of code that are semantically related to each other. This leads to the design and implementation of a deep learning-based vulnerability detection system, called Vulnerability Deep Pecker (VulDeePecker). In order to evaluate VulDeePecker, we present the first vulnerability dataset for deep learning approaches. Experimental results show that VulDeePecker can achieve much fewer false negatives (with reasonable false positives) than other approaches. We further apply VulDeePecker to 3 software products (namely Xen, Seamonkey, and Libav) and detect 4 vulnerabilities, which are not reported in the National Vulnerability Database but were \"silently\" patched by the vendors when releasing later versions of these products; in contrast, these vulnerabilities are almost entirely missed by the other vulnerability detection systems we experimented with.",

In this paper we will describe parity code based concurrent error detection (CED) approach against such attacks in substitution-permutation network (SPN) symmetric block ciphers [22]. The basic idea compares a carefully modified parity of the input plain text with that of the output cipher text resulting in a simple CED circuitry. An analysis of the SPN symmetric block ciphers reveals that on one hand, permutation of the round outputs does not alter the parity from its input to its output. On the other hand, exclusive-or with the round key and the non-linear substitution function (s-box) modify the parity from their inputs to their outputs. In order to change the parity of the inputs into the parity of outputs of an SPN encryption, we exclusive-or the parity of the SPN round function output with the parity of the round key. We also add to all s-boxes an additional 1-bit binary function that implements the combined parity of the inputs and outputs to the s-box for all its (input, output) pairs. These two modifications are used only by the CED circuitry and do not impact the SPN encryption or decryption. The proposed CED approach is demonstrated on a 16-input, 16-output SPN symmetric block cipher from [1].",

It covers known assumptions such as DDH, Lin2 (linear assumption), and k − Lin (the k-linear assumption). Using our algebraic viewpoint, we can relate the generic hardness of our assumptions in m-linear groups to the irreducibility of certain polynomials which describe the output of \\(\\mathcal{D}_{\\ell,k}\\). We use the hardness results to find new distributions for which the \\(\\mathcal{D}_{\\ell,k}\\mathsf{MDDH}\\)-Assumption holds generically in m-linear groups. In particular, our new assumptions 2−SCasc and 2−ILin are generically hard in bilinear groups and, compared to 2 − Lin, have shorter description size, which is a relevant parameter for efficiency in many applications. These results support using our new assumptions as natural replacements for the 2 − Lin Assumption which was already used in a large number of applications.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, some countermeasures against Differential Power Analysis (DPA) at the logic level have been proposed. At CHES 2005 conference, Popp and Mangard proposed a new countermeasure named Masked Dual-Rail Pre-Charge Logic (MDPL) which combine dual-rail circuits with random masking to improve Wave Dynamic Differential Logic (WDDL). The proposers of MDPL claim that it can implement secure circuits using a standard CMOS cell library without special constraints for the place-and-route because the difference of loading capacitance between all pairs of complementary logic gates in MDPL can be covered up by the random masking. In this paper, we especially focus the signal transition of the MDPL gate and evaluate the DPA-resistance of MDPL in detail. Our evaluation results show that the leakage occurs in the MDPL gates as well as WDDL gates when input signals have difference of delay time even if MDPL has an effectiveness on reducing the leakage caused by the difference of loading capacitance. Furthermore, we demonstrate the problem with different input signal delays by measurements of an FPGA and show the validity of our evaluation.",

Montgomery multiplication based on residue number systems was used. Thanks to RNS, a design which is able to perform an RSA signature in parallel on was developed a set of identical and independent coprocessors. Of independent interest, the authors proposed a new DPA countermeasure when RNS are used that is only (slightly) memory consuming. Finally, the new architecture was synthesized on FPGA and it presents promising performance results. Even if the aim is to sketch a secure architecture, the RSA signature is performed in less than 150 ms, with competitive hardware resources. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first proposal of an architecture counteracting electromagnetic analysis apart from hardware countermeasures reducing electromagnetic radiations",

Using the R-ate pairing, the loop length in Miller's algorithm can be as small as log (r1/phi(k)) some pairing-friendly elliptic curves which have not reached this lower bound. Therefore, we obtain savings of between 29% and 69% in overall costs compared to the Atei pairing. On supersingular hyperelliptic curves of genus 2, we show that this approach makes the loop length in Miller's algorithm shorter than that of the Ate pairing.",

Our result is constructive: given black-box access to a combinatorial auction algorithm A, sample access to the prior distribution, and appropriate query access to the sampled valuations, one can compute, in polytime, prices that guarantee at least half of the expected welfare of A. As a corollary, we obtain the first polytime (in n and m) constant-factor DSIC mechanism for Bayesian submodular combinatorial auctions, given access to demand query oracles. Our results also extend to valuations with complements, where the approximation factor degrades linearly with the level of complementarity.",

We need approximately 1500 faulty ciphertexts to discover the key with the other fault model. Union of these models covers all faults that can occur in the 9th round of encryption algorithm of AES-128 cryptosystem. One of main advantage of proposed fault models is that any fault in the AES encryption from start (AddRoundKey with the main key before the first round) to MixColumns function of 9th round can be modeled with one of our fault models. These models cover all states, so generated differences caused by diverse plaintexts or ciphertexts can be supposed as faults and modeled with our models. It establishes a novel technique to cryptanalysis AES without side channel information. The major difference between these methods and previous ones is on the assumption of fault models. Our proposed fault models use very common and general assumption for locations and values of occurred faults.",

They will soon be replaced in third generation networks by a new A5/3 block cipher called KASUMI, which is a modified version of the MISTY cryptosystem. In this paper we describe a new type of attack called a sandwich attack, and use it to construct a simple distinguisher for 7 of the 8 rounds of KASUMI with an amazingly high probability of 2. By using this distinguisher and analyzing the single remaining round, we can derive the complete 128 bit key of the full KASUMI by using only 4 related keys, 2 data, 2 bytes of memory, and 2 time. These complexities are so small that we have actually simulated the attack in less than two hours on a single PC, and experimentally verified its correctness and complexity. Interestingly, neither our technique nor any other published attack can break MISTY in less than the 2 complexity of exhaustive search, which indicates that the changes made by the GSM Association in moving from MISTY to KASUMI resulted in a much weaker cryptosystem.",

      "abstract": "With the rapid increase in Android device popularity, the capabilities that the diverse user base demands from Android have significantly exceeded its original design. As a result, people have to seek ways to obtain the permissions not directly offered to ordinary users. A typical way to do that is using the Android Debug Bridge (ADB), a developer tool that has been granted permissions to use critical system resources. Apps adopting this solution have combined tens of millions of downloads on Google Play. However, we found that such ADB-level capabilities are not well guarded by Android. A prominent example we investigated is the apps that perform programmatic screenshots, a much-needed capability Android fails to support. We found that all such apps in the market inadvertently expose this ADB capability to any party with the INTERNET permission on the same device. With this exposure, a malicious app can be built to stealthily and intelligently collect sensitive user data through screenshots. To understand the threat, we built Screenmilker, an app that can detect the right moment to monitor the screen and pick up a user’s password when she is typing in real time. We show that this can be done efficiently by leveraging the unique design of smartphone user interfaces and its public resources. Such an understanding also informs Android developers how to protect this screenshot capability, should they consider providing an interface to let third-party developers use it in the future, and more generally the security risks of the ADB workaround, a standard technique gaining popularity in app development. Based on the understanding, we present a mitigation mechanism that controls the exposure of the ADB capabilities only to authorized apps.",

      "abstract": "Remote attestation is the process of verifying internal state of a remote embedded device. It is an important component of many security protocols and applications. Although previously proposed remote attestation techniques assisted by specialized secure hardware are effective, they not yet viable for low-cost embedded devices. One notable alternative is software-based attestation, that is both less costly and more efficient. However, recent results identified weaknesses in some proposed software-based methods, thus showing that security of remote software attestation remains a challenge. \n \nInspired by these developments, this paper explores an approach that relies neither on secure hardware nor on tight timing constraints typical of software-based technqiques. By taking advantage of the bounded memory/storage model of low-cost embedded devices and assuming a small amount of read-only memory (ROM), our approach involves a new primitive - Proofs of Secure Erasure (PoSE-s). We also show that, even though it is effective and provably secure, PoSE-based attestation is not cheap. However, it is particularly well-suited and practical for two other related tasks: secure code update and secure memory/storage erasure. We consider several flavors of PoSE-based protocols and demonstrate their feasibility in the context of existing commodity embedded devices.",

      "abstract": "This article considers the problem of how to prevent the fast RSA signature and decryption computation with residue number system (or called the CRT-based approach) speedup from a hardware fault cryptanalysis in a highly reliable and efficient approach. The CRT-based speedup for RSA signature has been widely adopted as an implementation standard ranging from large servers to very tiny smart IC cards. However, given a single erroneous computation result, a hardware fault cryptanalysis can totally break the RSA system by factoring the public modulus. Some countermeasures by using a simple verification function (e.g., raising a signature to the power of public key) or fault detection (e.g., an expanded modulus approach) have been reported in the literature, however it will be pointed out in this paper that very few of these existing solutions are both sound and efficient. Unreasonably, in these methods, they assume that a comparison instruction will always be fault free when developing countermeasures against hardware fault cryptanalysis. Researches show that the expanded modulus approach proposed by Shamir is superior to the approach of using a simple verification function when other physical cryptanalysis (e.g., timing cryptanalysis) is considered. So, we intend to improve Shamir's method. In this paper, the new concept of fault infective CRT computation and fault infective CRT recombination are proposed. Based on the new concept, two novel protocols are developed with rigorous proof of security. Two possible parameter settings are provided for the protocols. One setting is to select a small public key e and the proposed protocols can have comparable performance to Shamir's scheme. The other setting is to have better performance than Shamir's scheme (i.e., having comparable performance to conventional CRT speedup) but with a large public key. Most importantly, we wish to emphasize the importance of developing and proving the security of physically secure protocols without relying on unreliable or unreasonable assumptions, e.g., always fault free instructions.",

It is therefore crucial to design solutions able to respond to this demand with a clear integration strategy for existing applications and a consideration of the performance impact of the protection measures. \n \nIn this paper we address this problem and propose a solution to enforce privacy over data collections by combining data fragmentation with encryption. The idea behind our approach is to use encryption as an underlying (conveniently available) measure for making data unintelligible, while exploiting fragmentation as a way to break sensitive associations between information.",

Contactless smartcards are becoming increasingly popular, with applications like credit-cards, national-ID, passports, physical access. The security of such applications is clearly critical. A key feature of RFID-based systems is their very short range: typical systems are designed to operate at a range of ≈ 10cm. In this study we show that contactless smartcard technology is vulnerable to relay attacks: An attacker can trick the reader into communicating with a victim smartcard that is very far away. A \"low-tech\" attacker can build a pick-pocket system that can remotely use a victim contactless smartcard, without the victim’s knowledge. The attack system consists of two devices, which we call the \"ghost\" and the \"leech\". We discuss basic designs for the attacker’s equipment, and explore their possible operating ranges. We show that the ghost can be up to 50m away from the card reader— 3 orders of magnitude higher than the nominal range. We also show that the leech can be up to 50cm away from the the victim card. The main characteristics of the attack are: orthogonality to any security protocol, unlimited distance between the attacker and the victim, and low cost of the attack system.",

Based on this we recover security of popular classes of message authentication schemes such as MACs (including HMAC and PRF-based MACs) and CWschemes. Furthermore, in many cases we do so with a tight security reduction, so that in the end the news we bring is surprisingly positive given the initial negative result.

Since the hardness of the CDH problem is widely believed to be closely related to the hardness of the DL problem, the signature scheme presented here offers better security guarantees than existing discrete-log based signature schemes. Furthermore, the new scheme has comparable efficiency to existing schemes. \n \nThe signature scheme was previously proposed in the cryptographic literature on at least two occasions. However, no security analysis was done, probably because the scheme was viewed as a slight modification of Schnorr signatures. In particular, the scheme's tight security reduction to CDH has remained unnoticed until now. Interestingly, this discrete-log based signature scheme is similar to the trapdoor permutation based PSS signatures proposed by Bellare and Rogaway, and has a tight reduction for a similar reason.",

      "abstract": "One-way chains are an important cryptographic primitive in many security applications. As one-way chains are very efficient to verify, they recently became increasingly popular for designing security protocols for resource-constrained mobile devices and sensor networks, as their low-powered processors can compute a one-way function within milliseconds, but would require tens of seconds or up to minutes to generate or verify a traditional digital signature [6]. Recent sensor network security protocols thus extensively use one-way chains to design protocols that scale down to resource-constrained sensors [21,29]. Recently, researchers also proposed a variety of improvements to one-way hash chains to make storage and access more efficient [9,18,33], or to make setup and verification more efficient [17,21]. \n \nIn this paper we present two new constructions for one-way hash chains, which significantly improve the efficiency of one-way chains. Our first construction, the Sandwich-chain, provides a smaller bandwidth overhead for one-way chain values, and enables efficient verification of one-way chain values if the trusted one-way chain value is far away. Our second construction, Comb Skipchain, features a new lower bound for one-way chains in terms of storage and traversal overhead. In fact previously, researchers [9] cite a lower bound of log2(n) for the product of per-value traversal overhead and memory requirements for one-dimensional chains. We show that one can achieve a lower bound by considering multi-dimensional chains. In particular, our two-dimensional construction requires O(log(n)) memory and O(1) traversal overhead, thereby improving on the one-dimensional bound. In addition, the setup cost for the one-way chain is in contrast only O(n/log(n)). Other benefits for both constructions include a faster verification step than the traditional hash chains provide; a verifier can “catch up” efficiently, after having missed some number of previously released hash values (for the Sandwich-chain); and resistance against DoS attacks on authentication values. Moreover, we describe fractal traversal schemes for our proposed structures, bringing down the traversal costs for our structure to the same as those of the simpler “traditional” hash chain. \n \nOur new construction is orthogonal to most previously proposed techniques, and can be used in conjunction with techniques for efficient setup or verification of one-way chains.",

In this paper, we show that current scalability measures adopted by Bitcoin come at odds with the security of the system. More specifically, we show that an adversary can exploit these measures in order to effectively delay the propagation of transactions and blocks to specific nodes for a considerable amount of time---without causing a network partitioning in the system. Notice that this attack alters the information received by Bitcoin nodes, and modifies their views of the ledger state. Namely, we show that this allows the adversary to considerably increase its mining advantage in the network, and to double-spend transactions in spite of the current countermeasures adopted by Bitcoin. Based on our results, we propose a number of countermeasures in order to enhance the security of Bitcoin without deteriorating its scalability.",

A solution for this problem in a high-speed network environment necessitates lightweight mechanisms for differentiating between valid traffic and the attacker's packets. The main challenge in presenting such a solution is to exploit existing packet-filtering mechanisms in a way that allows fast processing of packets but is complex enough so that the attacker cannot efficiently craft packets that pass the filters. We show a protocol that mitigates DoS attacks by adversaries that can eavesdrop and (with some delay) adapt their attacks accordingly. The protocol uses only available efficient packet-filtering mechanisms based mainly on addresses and port numbers. Our protocol avoids the use of fixed ports and instead performs \"pseudorandom port hopping.\" We model the underlying packet-filtering services and define measures for the capabilities of the adversary and for the success rate of the protocol. Using these, we provide a novel rigorous analysis of the impact of DoS on an end-to-end protocol and show that our protocol provides effective DoS prevention for realistic attack and deployment scenarios.",

Given a positive integer \\(p\\ge 2\\) and a class \\(\\mathcal F\\) of functions \\(f:\\{0,1\\}^n\\rightarrow \\mathbb G\\), where \\(\\mathbb G\\) is an Abelian group, a \\(p\\)-party FSS scheme for \\(\\mathcal F\\) allows one to split each \\(f\\in \\mathcal F\\) into \\(p\\) succinctly described functions \\(f_i:\\{0,1\\}^n\\rightarrow \\mathbb G\\), \\(1\\le i\\le p\\), such that: (1) \\(\\sum _{i=1}^p f_i=f\\), and (2) any strict subset of the \\(f_i\\) hides \\(f\\).

Although the size of its trapdoors is linear in the number of documents being searched, we empirically show that this overhead remains reasonable in practice. Nonetheless, to address this limitation we provide an alternative based on bilinear pairings that yields constant size trapdoors.

Our algorithm is suitable to emerging applications where signal is presented in a stream, size of the signal is very large, and one must construct the histogram using significantly smaller space than the signal size.

These elements are examined to determine if any of them can be removed from the hands of a possible system infiltrator, and thus increase the security of the system. We conclude that the single most important step that can be taken to improve password security is to increase password entropy.",

      "abstract": "One difficulty in the cryptanalysis of the Advanced Encryption Standard AES is the tension between operations in the two fields GF(28) and GF(2). This paper outlines a new approach that avoids this conflict. We define a new block cipher, the BES, that uses only simple algebraic operations in GF(28). Yet the AES can be regarded as being identical to the BES with a restricted message space and key space, thus enabling the AES to be realised solely using simple algebraic operations in one field GF(28). This permits the exploration of the AES within a broad and rich setting. One consequence is that AES encryption can be described by an extremely sparse overdetermined multivariate quadratic system over GF(28), whose solution would recover an AES key.",

      "abstract": "The difference between theory and practice often rests on one major factor: efficiency. In distributed systems, communication is usually expensive, and protocols designed for practical use must require as few rounds of communication and as small messages as possible.A secure multiparty protocol to compute function F is a protocol that, when each player i of n players starts with private input xi, provides each participant i with F(x1,...xn) without revealing more information than what can be derived from learning the function value. Some number l of players may be corrupted by an adversary who may then change the messages they send. Recent solutions to this problem have suffered in practical terms: while theoretically using only polynomially-many rounds, in practice the constants and exponents of such polynomials are too great. Normally, such protocols express F as a circuit CF, call on each player to secretly share xi, and proceed to perform \"secret addition and multiplication\" on secretly shared values. The cost is proportional to the depth of CF times the cost of secret multiplication; and multiplication requires several rounds of interaction.We present a protocol that simplifies the body of such a protocol and significantly reduces the number of rounds of interaction. The steps of our protocol take advantage of a new and counterintuitive technique for evaluating a circuit: set every input to every gate in the circuit completely at random, and then make corrections. Our protocol replaces each secret multiplication -- multiplication that requires further sharing, addition, zero-knowledge proofs, and secret reconstruction -- that is used during the body of a standard protocol by a simple reconstruction of secretly shared values, thereby reducing rounds by an order of magnitude. Furthermore, these reconstructions require only broadcast messages (but do not require Byzantine Agreement). The simplicity of broadcast and reconstruction provides efficiency and ease of implementation. Our transformation is simple and compatible with other techniques for reducing rounds.",

This paper shows that carefully coded implementations of these hash functions are able to exploit the Pentium's superscalar architecture to its maximum effect: the performance with respect to execution on a non-parallel architecture increases by about 60%. This is an important result in view of the recent claims on the limited data bandwidth of these hash functions. Moreover, it is conjectured that these implementations are very close to optimal. It will also be shown that the performance penalty incurred by non-cached data and endianness conversion is limited, and in the order of 10% of running time.",

The advantage of this measure on other measures such as the Hausdorff distance is that it takes into account the ordering of the points along the curves. \nThe discrete Fr\\'echet distance replaces the dog and its owner by a pair of frogs that can only reside on $n$ and $m$ specific pebbles on the curves $A$ and $B$, respectively. These frogs hop from a pebble to the next without backtracking. The discrete Fr\\'echet distance can be computed by a rather straightforward quadratic dynamic programming algorithm. However, despite a considerable amount of work on this problem and its variations, there is no subquadratic algorithm known, even for approximation versions of the problem. \nIn this paper we present a subquadratic algorithm for computing the discrete Fr\\'echet distance between two sequences of points in the plane, of respective lengths $m\\le n$.

This gives the signer additional control over who will benefit from being convinced by a signature, and is particularly relevant when signing sensitive, non-public data. Convertible undeniable signatures offer additional flexibility in that there is a separate verification key that can be used to verify a signature (without interaction). This allows the signer to delegate the ability to verify signatures to one or more participants, and ultimately to convert all signatures to ordinary ones by making the verification key public. While provably secure theoretical solutions exist for convertible schemes, earlier practical schemes proposed have either been broken or their status as far as security is concerned is very unclear. In this paper, we present two new convertible schemes, in which forging signatures is provably equivalent to forging El Gamal signatures. The difficulty of verifying signatures without interacting with the signer is based on the factoring problem for one of the schemes and on the Diffie-Hellman problem for the other scheme.",

A realistic model is to assume that leakages are sufficiently noisy, following real-world observations. While the noisy leakage assumption has first been studied in the seminal work of Chari et al. (CRYPTO 99), the recent work of Prouff and Rivain (Eurocrypt 2013) provides the first analysis of a full masking scheme under a physically motivated noise model. Unfortunately, the security analysis of Prouff and Rivain has three important shortcomings: (1) it requires leak-free gates, (2) it considers a restricted adversarial model (random message attacks), and (3) the security proof has limited application for cryptographic settings. In this work, we provide an alternative security proof in the same noisy model that overcomes these three challenges. We achieve this goal by a new reduction from noisy leakage to the important theoretical model of probing adversaries (Ishai et al – CRYPTO 2003). Our work can be viewed as a next step of closing the gap between theory and practice in leakage resilient cryptography: while our security proofs heavily rely on concepts of theoretical cryptography, we solve problems in practically motivated leakage models.",

Previous polynomial-time attacks on GGH13 were \"zeroizing\" attacks that generally required the availability of low-level encodings of zero. Most significantly, such zeroizing attacks were not applicable to candidate indistinguishability obfuscation iO schemes. iO has been the subject of intense study. \n \nTo address this gap, we introduce annihilation attacks, which attack multilinear maps using non-linear polynomials. Annihilation attacks can work in situations where there are no low-level encodings of zero. Using annihilation attacks, we give the first polynomial-time cryptanalysis of candidate iO schemes over GGH13. More specifically, we exhibit two simple programs that are functionally equivalent, and show how to efficiently distinguish between the obfuscations of these two programs. \n \nGiven the enormous applicability of iO, it is important to devise iO schemes that can avoid attack. We discuss some initial directions for safeguarding against annihilating attacks.",

Charm provides a number of features that explicitly support the development of new protocols, including support for modular composition of cryptographic building blocks, infrastructure for developing interactive protocols, and an extensive library of re-usable code. Our framework also provides a series of specialized tools that enable different cryptosystems to interoperate. We implemented over 40 cryptographic schemes using Charm, including some new ones that, to our knowledge, have never been built in practice. This paper describes our modular architecture, which includes a built-in benchmarking module to compare the performance of Charm primitives to existing C implementations. We show that in many cases our techniques result in an order of magnitude decrease in code size, while inducing an acceptable performance impact. Lastly, the Charm framework is freely available to the research community and to date, we have developed a large, active user base.",

One is the attack devised by the second author against Knuth's truncated linear congruential generator.

We then transform it into a fully homomorphic encryption scheme using standard \"squashing\" and \"bootstrapping\" techniques introduced by Gentry (STOC 2009). \n \nOne of the obstacles in going from \"somewhat\" to full homomorphism is the requirement that the somewhat homomorphic scheme be circular secure, namely, the scheme can be used to securely encrypt its own secret key. For all known somewhat homomorphic encryption schemes, this requirement was not known to be achievable under any cryptographic assumption, and had to be explicitly assumed. We take a step forward towards removing this additional assumption by proving that our scheme is in fact secure when encrypting polynomial functions of the secret key. \n \nOur scheme is based on the ring learning with errors (RLWE) assumption that was recently introduced by Lyubashevsky, Peikert and Regev (Eurocrypt 2010). The RLWE assumption is reducible to worstcase problems on ideal lattices, and allows us to completely abstract out the lattice interpretation, resulting in an extremely simple scheme. For example, our secret key is s, and our public key is (a, b = as+2e), where s, a, e are all degree (n - 1) integer polynomials whose coefficients are independently drawn from easy to sample distributions.",

The bitslice parallel encryption technique, initially proposed by Biham for speeding-up DES, has been successful on RISC processors with many long registers, but on the other side bitsliced ciphers are not widely used in real applications on PC platforms, because in many cases they were actually not very fast on previous PC processors. Moreover the bitslice mode requires a non-standard data format and hence an additional format conversion is needed for compatibility with an existing parallel mode of operation, which was considered to be expensive. \n \nThis paper demonstrates that some bitsliced ciphers have a remarkable performance gain on Intel's Core2 processor due to its enhanced SIMD architecture. We show that KASUMI, a UMTS/GSM mobile standard block cipher, can be four times faster when implemented using a bitslice technique on this processor. Also our bitsliced AES code runs at the speed of 9.2 cycles/byte, which is the performance record of AES ever made on a PC processor. Next we for the first time focus on how to optimize a conversion algorithm between a bitslice format and a standard format on a specific processor. As a result, the bitsliced AES code can be faster than a highly optimized \"standard AES\" code on Core2, even taking an overhead of the conversion into consideration. This means that in the CTR mode, bitsliced AES is not only fast but also fully compatible with an existing implementation and moreover secure against cache timing attacks, since a bitsliced cipher does not use any lookup tables with key/data-dependent address.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we define and explore proofs of retrievability (PORs). A POR scheme enables an archive or back-up service (prover) to produce a concise proof that a user (verifier) can retrieve a target file F, that is, that the archive retains and reliably transmits file data sufficient for the user to recover F in its entirety.\n A POR may be viewed as a kind of cryptographic proof of knowledge (POK), but one specially designed to handle a large file (or bitstring) F. We explore POR protocols here in which the communication costs, number of memory accesses for the prover, and storage requirements of the user (verifier) are small parameters essentially independent of the length of F. In addition to proposing new, practical POR constructions, we explore implementation considerations and optimizations that bear on previously explored, related schemes.\n In a POR, unlike a POK, neither the prover nor the verifier need actually have knowledge of F. PORs give rise to a new and unusual security definition whose formulation is another contribution of our work.\n We view PORs as an important tool for semi-trusted online archives. Existing cryptographic techniques help users ensure the privacy and integrity of files they retrieve. It is also natural, however, for users to want to verify that archives do not delete or modify files prior to retrieval. The goal of a POR is to accomplish these checks without users having to download the files themselves. A POR can also provide quality-of-service guarantees, i.e., show that a file is retrievable within a certain time bound.",

This paper proposes a statistical model for DPA that takes characteristics of both the physical implementation and cryptographic algorithm into consideration. Our model establishes a quantitative relation between the success rate of DPA and a cryptographic system. The side-channel characteristic of the physical implementation is modeled as the ratio between the difference-of-means power and the standard deviation of power distribution. The side-channel property of the cryptographic algorithm is extracted by a novel algorithmic confusion analysis. Experimental results on DES and AES verify this model and demonstrate the effectiveness of algorithmic confusion analysis.

      "abstract": "AbstractRecent targeted attacks have increased significantly in sophistication, undermining the fundamental assumptions on which most cryptographic primitives rely for security. For instance, attackers launching an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) can steal full cryptographic keys, violating the very secrecy of “secret” keys that cryptographers assume in designing secure protocols. In this article, we introduce a game-theoretic framework for modeling various computer security scenarios prevalent today, including targeted attacks. We are particularly interested in situations in which an attacker periodically compromises a system or critical resource completely, learns all its secret information and is not immediately detected by the system owner or defender. We propose a two-player game between an attacker and defender called FlipIt or The Game of “Stealthy Takeover.” In FlipIt, players compete to control a shared resource. Unlike most existing games, FlipIt allows players to move at any given time, taking control of the resource. The identity of the player controlling the resource, however, is not revealed until a player actually moves. To move, a player pays a certain move cost. The objective of each player is to control the resource a large fraction of time, while minimizing his total move cost. FlipIt provides a simple and elegant framework in which we can formally reason about the interaction between attackers and defenders in practical scenarios. In this article, we restrict ourselves to games in which one of the players (the defender) plays with a renewal strategy, one in which the intervals between consecutive moves are chosen independently and uniformly at random from a fixed probability distribution. We consider attacker strategies ranging in increasing sophistication from simple periodic strategies (with moves spaced at equal time intervals) to more complex adaptive strategies, in which moves are determined based on feedback received during the game. For different classes of strategies employed by the attacker, we determine strongly dominant strategies for both players (when they exist), strategies that achieve higher benefit than all other strategies in a particular class. When strongly dominant strategies do not exist, our goal is to characterize the residual game consisting of strategies that are not strongly dominated by other strategies. We also prove equivalence or strict inclusion of certain classes of strategies under different conditions. Our analysis of different FlipIt variants teaches cryptographers, system designers, and the community at large some valuable lessons: 1.Systems should be designed under the assumption of repeated total compromise, including theft of cryptographic keys. FlipIt provides guidance on how to implement a cost-effective defensive strategy.2.Aggressive play by one player can motivate the opponent to drop out of the game (essentially not to play at all). Therefore, moving fast is a good defensive strategy, but it can only be implemented if move costs are low. We believe that virtualization has a huge potential in this respect.3.Close monitoring of one’s resources is beneficial in detecting potential attacks faster, gaining insight into attacker’s strategies, and scheduling defensive moves more effectively.\n Interestingly, FlipIt finds applications in other security realms besides modeling of targeted attacks. Examples include cryptographic key rotation, password changing policies, refreshing virtual machines, and cloud auditing.",

However, these systems work within a stateless model: they exclude computations that interact with RAM or a disk, or for which the client does not have the full input.\n This paper describes Pantry, a built system that overcomes these limitations. Pantry composes proof-based verifiable computation with untrusted storage: the client expresses its computation in terms of digests that attest to state, and verifiably outsources that computation. Using Pantry, we extend verifiability to MapReduce jobs, simple database queries, and interactions with private state. Thus, Pantry takes another step toward practical proof-based verifiable computation for realistic applications.",

      "abstract": "Searchable symmetric encryption (SSE) enables a client to outsource a collection of encrypted documents in the cloud and retain the ability to perform keyword searches without revealing information about the contents of the documents and queries. Although efficient SSE constructions are known, previous solutions are highly sequential. This is mainly due to the fact that, currently, the only method for achieving sub-linear time search is the inverted index approach (Curtmola, Garay, Kamara and Ostrovsky, CCS ’06) which requires the search algorithm to access a sequence of memory locations, each of which is unpredictable and stored at the previous location in the sequence. Motivated by advances in multi-core architectures, we present a new method for constructing sub-linear SSE schemes. Our approach is highly parallelizable and dynamic. With roughly a logarithmic number of cores in place, searches for a keyword w in our scheme execute in o(r) parallel time, where r is the number of documents containing keyword w (with more cores, this bound can go down to O(logn), i.e., independent of the result size r). Such time complexity outperforms the optimal Θ(r) sequential search time—a similar bound holds for the updates. Our scheme also achieves the following important properties: (a) it enjoys a strong notion of security, namely security against adaptive chosen-keyword attacks; (b) compared to existing sub-linear dynamic SSE schemes (e.g., Kamara, Papamanthou, Roeder, CCS ’12), updates in our scheme do not leak any information, apart from information that can be inferred from previous search tokens; (c) it can be implemented efficiently in external memory (with logarithmic I/O overhead). Our technique is simple and uses a red-black tree data structure; its security is proven in the random oracle model.",

The main result is a linear secret sharing scheme (LSSS) defined over a finite field ${\\mathbb F}_q$, with the following properties. \n \n1. It is ideal. The number of players n can be as large as $\\#C({\\mathbb F}_q)$, where C is an algebraic curve C of genus g defined over ${\\mathbb F}_q$. \n \n2. It is quasi-threshold: it is t-rejecting and t+1+2g-accepting, but not necessarily t+1-accepting. It is thus in particular a ramp scheme. High information rate can be achieved. \n \n3. It has strong multiplication with respect to the t-threshold adversary structure, if $t<\\frac{1}{3}n-\\frac{4}{3}g$. This is a multi-linear algebraic property on an LSSS facilitating zero-error multi-party multiplication, unconditionally secure against corruption by an active t-adversary. \n \n4. The finite field ${\\mathbb F}_q$ can be dramatically smaller than n. This is by using algebraic curves with many ${\\mathbb F}_q$-rational points. For example, for each small enough e, there is a finite field ${\\mathbb F}_q$ such that for infinitely many n there is an LSSS over ${\\mathbb F}_q$ with strong multiplication satisfying $(\\frac{1}{3}- \\epsilon) n\\leq t < \\frac{1}{3}n$. \n \n5. Shamir's scheme, which requires n>q and which has strong multiplication for $t<\\frac{1}{3}n$, is a special case by taking g=0. \n \nNow consider the classical (“BGW”) scenario of MPC unconditionally secure (with zero error probability) against an active t-adversary with $t<\\frac{1}{3}n$, in a synchronous n-player network with secure channels. By known results it now follows that there exist MPC protocols in this scenario, achieving the same communication complexities in terms of the number of field elements exchanged in the network compared with known Shamir-based solutions. However, in return for decreasing corruption tolerance by a small e-fraction, q may be dramatically smaller than n. This tolerance decrease is unavoidable due to properties of MDS codes. The techniques extend to other models of MPC. Results on less specialized LSSS can be obtained from more general coding theory arguments.",

We study the number of characteristics with EDP >0 whose probability adds up to the probability of a differential and derive formulas that allow to produce a close estimate of this number for any differential.

We introduce a framework for solving online problems that aim to minimize the congestion (i.e. the maximum load of a network link) in general topology networks. We apply this framework to the problem of online routing of virtual circuits and to a dynamic data management problem. For both scenarios we achieve a competitive ratio of O(log/sup 3/ n) with respect to the congestion of the network links. Our online algorithm for the routing problem has the remarkable property that it is oblivious, i.e., the path chosen for a virtual circuit is independent of the current network load. Oblivious routing strategies can easily be implemented in distributed environments and have therefore been intensively studied for certain network topologies as e.g. meshes, tori and hypercubic networks. This is the first oblivious path selection algorithm that achieves a polylogarithmic competitive ratio in general networks.",

We formally analyze the properties enforceable by various program monitors and find that although this belief is correct when considering monitors with simple remedial options, it is incorrect for more powerful monitors that can be modeled by edit automata. We define an interesting set of properties called infinite renewal properties and demonstrate how, when given any reasonable infinite renewal property, to construct an edit automaton that provably enforces that property.

In particular, they provide strong solutions to the problem of verifiably delegating computation. We construct the first fully-succinct publicly-verifiable SNARK. To do that, we first show how to \"bootstrap\" any SNARK that requires expensive preprocessing to obtain a SNARK that does not, while preserving public verifiability. We then apply this transformation to known SNARKs with preprocessing. Moreover, the SNARK we construct only requires of the prover time and space that are essentially the same as that required for classical NP verification. Our transformation assumes only collision-resistant hashing; curiously, it does not rely on PCPs. We also show an analogous transformation for privately-verifiable SNARKs, assuming fully-homomorphic encryption.\n At the heart of our transformations is a technique for recursive composition of SNARKs. This technique uses in an essential way the proof-carrying data (PCD) framework, which extends SNARKs to the setting of distributed networks of provers and verifiers. Concretely, to bootstrap a given SNARK, we recursively compose the SNARK to obtain a \"weak\" PCD system for shallow distributed computations, and then use the PCD framework to attain stronger notions of SNARKs and PCD systems.",

In this paper, we give an analytical survey of authentication protocols of this type. We start with non-interactive authentication schemes, and then move on to analyse a number of strategies used to build interactive pair-wise and group protocols that minimise the human work relative to the amount of security obtained as well as optimising the computation processing.

VBB, if such obfuscators exist then there exist multi-bit point obfuscators (aka \"digital lockers\") and subsequently also very strong variants of encryption that are resilient to various attacks, such as key leakage and key-dependent-messages. However, no composable VBB-obfuscators for point programs have been shown. We show fully composable VGB-obfuscators for point programs under a strong variant of the Decision Diffie Hellman assumption.

Whereas standard cube attacks [4] find the key by solving a system of linear equations in the key bits, the new attack recovers the secret key by exploiting distinguishers obtained from cube testers. Dynamic cube attacks can create lower degree representations of the given cipher, which makes it possible to attack schemes that resist all previously known attacks. In this paper we concentrate on the well-known stream cipher Grain-128 [6], on which the best known key recovery attack [15] can recover only 2 key bits when the number of initialization rounds is decreased from 256 to 213. Our first attack runs in practical time complexity and recovers the full 128-bit key when the number of initialization rounds in Grain-128 is reduced to 207. Our second attack breaks a Grain-128 variant with 250 initialization rounds and is faster than exhaustive search by a factor of about 228. Finally, we present an attack on the full version of Grain-128 which can recover the full key but only when it belongs to a large subset of 2-10 of the possible keys. This attack is faster than exhaustive search over the 2118 possible keys by a factor of about 215. All of our key recovery attacks are the best known so far, and their correctness was experimentally verified rather than extrapolated from smaller variants of the cipher. This is the first time that a cube attack was shown to be effective against the full version of a well known cipher which resisted all previous attacks.",

In this paper, we focus on identifying candidate oneway functions hidden in cryptographic algorithms, inverting which will result in breaking the algorithm. The results we obtain on stream and block ciphers are the most important ones. For streamciphers using IV, we show that if the IV is shorter than the key, then the algorithm is vulnerable to TMTO. Further, from a TMTO point of view, it makes no sense to increase the size of the internal state of a streamcipher without increasing the size of the IV. This has impact on the recent ECRYPT call for streamcipher primitives and clears an almost decade old confusion on the size of key versus state of a streamcipher. For blockciphers, we consider various modes of operations and show that to different degrees all of these are vulnerable to TMTO attacks. In particular, we describe multiple data chosen plaintext TMTO attacks on the CBC and CFB modes of operations. This clears a quarter century old confusion on this issue starting from Hellman’s seminal paper in 1980 to Shamir’s invited talk at Asiacrypt 2004.

A secret sharing scheme permits a secret to be shared among participants of an n-element group in such a way that only qualified subsets of participants can recover the secret. If any nonqualified subset has absolutely no information on the secret, then the scheme is called perfect. The share in a scheme is the information that a participant must remember. In [3] it was proved that for a certain access structure any perfect secret sharing scheme must give some participant a share which is at least 50\\percent larger than the secret size. We prove that for each n there exists an access structure on n participants so that any perfect sharing scheme must give some participant a share which is at least about \n $n/\\log n$ times the secret size.^1 We also show that the best possible result achievable by the information-theoretic method used here is n times the secret size.\n ^1 All logarithms in this paper are of base 2.",

The security of almost all coding and LPN/LWE-based schemes relies on the assumption that it is hard to decode random linear codes. Recently, there has been progress in improving the running time of the best decoding algorithms for binary random codes. The ball collision technique of Bernstein, Lange and Peters lowered the complexity of Stern's information set decoding algorithm to 20.0556n. Using representations this bound was improved to 20.0537n by May, Meurer and Thomae.

A natural generalization of this approach is to consider systems of several modular equations in several variables. In this paper we consider Patarin's Hidden Field Equations (HFE) scheme, which is believed to be one of the strongest schemes of this type. We represent the published system of multivariate polynomials by a single univariate polynomial of a special form over an extension field, and use it to reduce the cryptanalytic problem to a system of Ɛm2 quadratic equations in m variables over the extension field. Finally, we develop a new relinearization method for solving such systems for any constant Ɛ > 0 in expected polynomial time. The new type of attack is quite general, and in a companion paper we use it to attack other multivariate algebraic schemes, such as the Dragon encryption and signature schemes. However, we would like to emphasize that the polynomial time complexities may be infeasibly large for some choices of the parameters, and thus some variants of these schemes may remain practically unbroken in spite of the new attack.",

Our framework improves the previously proposed POR constructions of Juels-Kaliski and Shacham-Waters, and also sheds light on the conceptual limitations of previous theoretical models for PORs. It supports a fully Byzantine adversarial model, carrying only the restriction---fundamental to all PORs---that the adversary's error rate be bounded when the client seeks to extract F. We propose a new variant on the Juels-Kaliski protocol and describe a prototype implementation. We demonstrate practical encoding even for files F whose size exceeds that of client main memory.",

They conjectured that their linear analysis is optimal and that the use of 12 rounds for RC5 is sufficient to make both differential and linear cryptanalysis impractical. In this paper we show that the differential analysis made by Kaliski and Yin is not optimal. We give differential attacks better by up to a factor of 512. Also we show that RC5 has many weak keys with respect to differential attacks. This weakness relies on the structure of the cipher and not on the key schedule.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we show structural cryptanalyses against two popular networks, i.e., the Feistel Network and the Substitute-Permutation Network (SPN). Our cryptanalyses are distinguishing attacks by an improved integral distinguisher. The integral distinguisher is one of the most powerful attacks against block ciphers, and it is usually constructed by evaluating the propagation characteristic of integral properties, e.g., the ALL or BALANCE property. However, the integral property does not derive useful distinguishers against block ciphers with non-bijective functions and bit-oriented structures. Moreover, since the integral property does not clearly exploit the algebraic degree of block ciphers, it tends not to construct useful distinguishers against block ciphers with low-degree functions. In this paper, we propose a new property called the division property, which is the generalization of the integral property. It can effectively construct the integral distinguisher even if the block cipher has non-bijective functions, bit-oriented structures, and low-degree functions. From viewpoints of the attackable number of rounds or chosen plaintexts, the division property can construct better distinguishers than previous methods. Although our attack is a generic attack, it can improve several integral distinguishers against specific cryptographic primitives. For instance, it can reduce the required number of chosen plaintexts for the \\(10\\)-round distinguisher on Keccak-\\(f\\) from \\(2^{1025}\\) to \\(2^{515}\\). For the Feistel cipher, it theoretically proves that Simon 32, 48, 64, 96, and 128 have \\(9\\)-, \\(11\\)-, \\(11\\)-, \\(13\\)-, and \\(13\\)-round integral distinguishers, respectively.",

In this paper, we present an analytical calculation of the success probability of linear and differential cryptanalytic attacks. The results apply to an extended sense of the term “success” where the correct key is found not necessarily as the highest-ranking candidate but within a set of high-ranking candidates. Experimental results show that the analysis provides accurate results in most cases, especially in linear cryptanalysis. In cases where the results are less accurate, as in certain cases of differential cryptanalysis, the results are useful to provide approximate estimates of the success probability and the necessary plaintext requirement. The analysis also reveals that the attacked key length in differential cryptanalysis is one of the factors that affect the success probability directly besides the signal-to-noise ratio and the available plaintext amount.\n",

      "abstract": "Analyzing massive data sets has been one of the key motivations for studying streaming algorithms. In recent years, there has been significant progress in analysing distributions in a streaming setting, but the progress on graph problems has been limited. A main reason for this has been the existence of linear space lower bounds for even simple problems such as determining the connectedness of a graph. However, in many new scenarios that arise from social and other interaction networks, the number of vertices is significantly less than the number of edges. This has led to the formulation of the semi-streaming model where we assume that the space is (near) linear in the number of vertices (but not necessarily the edges), and the edges appear in an arbitrary (and possibly adversarial) order. \n \nHowever there has been limited progress in analysing graph algorithms in this model. In this paper we focus on graph sparsification, which is one of the major building blocks in a variety of graph algorithms. Further, there has been a long history of (non-streaming) sampling algorithms that provide sparse graph approximations and it a natural question to ask: since the end result of the sparse approximation is a small (linear) space structure, can we achieve that using a small space, and in addition using a single pass over the data? The question is interesting from the standpoint of both theory and practice and we answer the question in the affirmative, by providing a one pass $\\tilde{O}(n/\\epsilon^{2})$ space algorithm that produces a sparsification that approximates each cut to a (1 + *** ) factor. We also show that $\\Omega(n \\log \\frac1\\epsilon)$ space is necessary for a one pass streaming algorithm to approximate the min-cut, improving upon the *** (n ) lower bound that arises from lower bounds for testing connectivity.",

It is known to be existentially unforgeable for any TDP family $\\mathcal{F}$ [3], although a much tighter security reduction is known for a restrictive class of TDP's [10,14]— namely, those induced by a family of claw-free permutations (CFP) pairs. The latter result was shown [11] to match the best possible “black-box” security reduction in the random oracle model, irrespective of the TDP family $\\mathcal{F}$ (e.g., RSA) one might use. \n \nIn this work we investigate the question if it is possible to instantiate the random oracle h with a “real” family of hash functions $\\mathcal{H}$ such that the corresponding schemes can be proven secure in the standard model, under some natural assumption on the family $\\mathcal{F}$.

Moreover, this holds even if the choice of $\\mathcal{H}$ can arbitrarily depend on f. As an immediate corollary, we rule out instantiating FDH based on general claw-free permutations, which shows that in order to prove the security of FDH in the standard model one must utilize significantly more structure on $\\mathcal{F}$ than what is sufficient for the best proof of security in the random oracle model.",

This research program has been starting to spill over into more general security questions (such as law-enforcement strategy), and into the interface between security and sociology. Most recently it has started to interact with psychology, both through the psychology-and-economics tradition and in response to phishing. The promise of this research program is a novel framework for analyzing information security problems - one that is both principled and effective.",

A context can be defined by the status of some variables (e.g. location, time, temperature, noise, and light), the presence of other devices, a particular interaction between the user and the smartphone, or a combination of these. CRePE allows context-related policies to be defined either by the user or by trusted third parties.

In this paper, we show new algorithms for the case k > 2: we show a cube-root time algorithm for the case of k = 4 lists, and we give an algorithm with subexponential running time when k is unrestricted.We also give several applications to cryptanalysis, describing new subexponential algorithms for constructing one-more forgeries for certain blind signature schemes, for breaking certain incremental hash functions, and for finding low-weight parity check equations for fast correlation attacks on stream ciphers. In these applications, our algorithm runs in O(22?n) time for an n-bit modulus, demonstrating that moduli may need to be at least 1600 bits long for security against these new attacks.

      "abstract": "The existence of succinct non-interactive arguments for NP (i.e., non-interactive computationally sound proofs where the verifier’s work is essentially independent of the complexity of the NP non-deterministic verifier) has been an intriguing question for the past two decades. Other than CS proofs in the random oracle model (Micali in SIAM J Comput 30(4):1253–1298, 2000), prior to our work the only existing candidate construction is based on an elaborate assumption that is tailored to a specific protocol (Di Crescenzo and Lipmaa in Proceedings of the 4th conference on computability in Europe, 2008). We formulate a general and relatively natural notion of an extractable collision-resistant hash function (ECRH) and show that, if ECRHs exist, then a modified version of Di Crescenzo and Lipmaa’s protocol is a succinct non-interactive argument for NP. Furthermore, the modified protocol is actually a succinct non-interactive adaptive argument of knowledge (SNARK). We then propose several candidate constructions for ECRHs and relaxations thereof. We demonstrate the applicability of SNARKs to various forms of delegation of computation, to succinct non-interactive zero-knowledge arguments, and to succinct two-party secure computation. Finally, we show that SNARKs essentially imply the existence of ECRHs, thus demonstrating the necessity of the assumption. Going beyond $$\\hbox {ECRH}$$ECRHs, we formulate the notion of extractable one-way functions ($$\\hbox {EOWF}$$EOWFs). Assuming the existence of a natural variant of $$\\hbox {EOWF}$$EOWFs, we construct a two-message selective-opening-attack-secure commitment scheme and a three-round zero-knowledge argument of knowledge. Furthermore, if the $$\\hbox {EOWF}$$EOWFs are concurrently extractable, the three-round zero-knowledge protocol is also concurrent zero knowledge. Our constructions circumvent previous black-box impossibility results regarding these protocols by relying on $$\\hbox {EOWF}$$EOWFs as the non-black-box component in the security reductions.",

In this paper, we study unidirectional PRE, which the re-encryption key only enables delegation in one direction but not the opposite. In PKC 2009, Shao and Cao proposed a unidirectional PRE assuming the random oracle. However, we show that it is vulnerable to chosen-ciphertext attack (CCA). We then propose an efficient unidirectional PRE scheme (without resorting to pairings).

      "abstract": "Several recently proposed ciphers, for example Rijndael and Serpent, are built with layers of small S-boxes interconnected by linear key-dependent layers. Their security relies on the fact, that the classical methods of cryptanalysis (e.g. linear or differential attacks) are based on probabilistic characteristics, which makes their security grow exponentially with the number of rounds Nr.In this paper we study the security of such ciphers under an additional hypothesis: the S-box can be described by an overdefined system of algebraic equations (true with probability 1). We show that this is true for both Serpent (due to a small size of S-boxes) and Rijndael (due to unexpected algebraic properties). We study general methods known for solving overdefined systems of equations, such as XL from Eurocrypt'00, and show their inefficiency. Then we introduce a new method called XSL that uses the sparsity of the equations and their specific structure.The XSL attack uses only relations true with probability 1, and thus the security does not have to grow exponentially in the number of rounds. XSL has a parameter P, and from our estimations is seems that P should be a constant or grow very slowly with the number of rounds. The XSL attack would then be polynomial (or subexponential) in Nr, with a huge constant that is double-exponential in the size of the S-box. The exact complexity of such attacks is not known due to the redundant equations. Though the presented version of the XSL attack always gives always more than the exhaustive search for Rijndael, it seems to (marginally) break 256-bit Serpent. We suggest a new criterion for design of S-boxes in block ciphers: they should not be describable by a system of polynomial equations that is too small or too overdefined.",

Using an innovative patented technique we were able to detect and analyse in the first documented case of its kind, a backdoor inserted into the Actel/Microsemi ProASIC3 chips for accessing FPGA configuration. The backdoor was found amongst additional JTAG functionality and exists on the silicon itself, it was not present in any firmware loaded onto the chip. Using Pipeline Emission Analysis (PEA), our pioneered technique, we were able to extract the secret key to activate the backdoor, as well as other security keys such as the AES and the Passkey. This way an attacker can extract all the configuration data from the chip, reprogram crypto and access keys, modify low-level silicon features, access unencrypted configuration bitstream or permanently damage the device. Clearly this means the device is wide open to intellectual property (IP) theft, fraud, re-programming as well as reverse engineering of the design which allows the introduction of a new backdoor or Trojan. Most concerning, it is not possible to patch the backdoor in chips already deployed, meaning those using this family of chips have to accept the fact they can be easily compromised or will have to be physically replaced after a redesign of the silicon itself.",

      "abstract": "We provide the first construction of a concurrent and non-malleable zero knowledge argument for every language in NP. We stress that our construction is in the plain model with no common random string, trusted parties, or super-polynomial simulation. That is, we construct a zero knowledge protocol Pi such that for every polynomial-time adversary that can adaptively and concurrently schedule polynomially many executions of Pi, and corrupt some of the verifiers and some of the provers in these sessions, there is a polynomial-time simulator that can simulate a transcript of the entire execution, along with the witnesses for all statements proven by a corrupt prover to an honest verifier Our security model is the traditional model for concurrent zero knowledge, where the statements to be proven by the honest provers are fixed in advance and do not depend on the previous history (but can be correlated with each other); corrupted provers, of course, can chose the statements adaptively. We also prove that there exists some functionality F (a combination of zero knowledge and oblivious transfer) such that it is impossible to obtain a concurrent non-malleable protocol for F in this model. Previous impossibility results for composable protocols ruled out existence of protocols for a wider class of functionalities {including zero knowledge!) but only if these protocols were required to remain secure when executed concurrently with arbitrarily chosen different protocols (Lindell, FOCS 2003) or if these protocols were required to remain secure when the honest parties' inputs in each execution are chosen adaptively based on the results of previous executions (Lindell, TCC2004). We obtain an Otilde(n) -round protocol under the assumption that one-to-one one-way functions exist. This can be improved to Otilde(k log n) rounds under the assumption that there exist k-round statistically hiding commitment schemes. Our protocol is a black-box zero knowledge protocol",

It is shown by a counterexample that the intuitive result, formally stated and proved in the literature, that a cascade is at least as strong as the strongest component cipher, requires the uninterestingly restrictive assumption that the enemy cannot exploit information about the plaintext statistics. It is proved, for very general notions of breaking a cipher and of problem difficulty, that a cascade is at least as difficult to break as the first component cipher. A consequence of this result is that if the ciphers commute, then a cascade is at least as difficult to break as the most-difficult-to-break component cipher, i.e., the intuition that a cryptographic chain is at least as strong as its strongest link is then provably correct. It is noted that additive stream ciphers do commute, and this fact is used to suggest a strategy for designing secure practical ciphers. Other applications in cryptology are given of the arguments used to prove the cascade cipher result.",

To construct mobile agents, [KBC00] used an RSA-based undetachable signature scheme, but it does not provide server's non-repudiation because the undetachable signature does not contain server's signature.Mobile agent is a very good application example of proxy signature, and the undetachable signature can be considered as an example of proxy signature.

We use our new Ramsey partitions to design approximate distance oracles with a universal constant query time, closing a gap left open by Thorup and Zwick in [26]. Namely, we show that for any n point metric space X, and k \\geqslant 1, there exists an O(k)-approximate distance oracle whose storage requirement is O(n^{1 + 1/k} ), and whose query time is a universal constant.

The Threshold Implementation method is also based on multi-party computation but it is more area and randomness efficient. Moreover, it typically requires less clock-cycles since all parties can operate simultaneously. However, so far it is only provable secure against 1st-order DPA. We address this gap and extend the Threshold Implementation technique to higher orders. We define generic constructions and prove their security. To illustrate the approach, we provide 1st, 2nd and 3rd-order DPA-resistant implementations of the block cipher KATAN- 32.

      "abstract": "In this work, we introduce one-time programs, a new computational paradigm geared towards security applications. A one-time program can be executed on a single input, whose value can be specified at run time. Other than the result of the computation on this input, nothing else about the program is leaked. Hence, a one-time program is like a black box function that may be evaluated once and then “self destructs.” This also extends to k-time programs, which are like black box functions that can be evaluated k times and then self destruct. One-time programs serve many of the same purposes of program obfuscation, the obvious one being software protection, but also including applications such as temporary transfer of cryptographic ability. Moreover, the applications of one-time programs go well beyond those of obfuscation, since one-time programs can only be executed once (or more generally, a limited number of times) while obfuscated programs have no such bounds. For example, one-time programs lead naturally to electronic cash or token schemes: coins are generated by a program that can only be run once, and thus cannot be double spent. Most significantly, the new paradigm of one-time computing opens new avenues for conceptual research. In this work we explore one such avenue, presenting the new concept of “one-time proofs,” proofs that can only be verified once and then become useless and unconvincing. All these tasks are clearly impossible using software alone, as any piece of software can be copied and run again, enabling the user to execute the program on more than one input. All our solutions employ a secure memory device, inspired by the cryptographic notion of interactive oblivious transfer protocols, that stores two secret keys (k0, k1). The device takes as input a single bit b ∈ {0, 1}, outputs kb, and then self destructs. Using such devices, we demonstrate that for every input length, any standard program (Turing machine) can be efficiently compiled into a functionally equivalent one-time program. We also show how this memory device can be used to construct one-time proofs. Specifically, we show how to use this device to efficiently convert a classical witness for any NP statement, into “one-time proof” for that statement. ?

      "abstract": "Address space layout randomization (ASLR) is an important first line of defense against memory corruption attacks and a building block for many modern countermeasures. Existing attacks against ASLR rely on software vulnerabilities and/or on repeated (and detectable) memory probing. In this paper, we show that neither is a hard requirement and that ASLR is fundamentally insecure on modern cachebased architectures, making ASLR and caching conflicting requirements (ASLR⊕Cache, or simply AnC). To support this claim, we describe a new EVICT+TIME cache attack on the virtual address translation performed by the memory management unit (MMU) of modern processors. Our AnC attack relies on the property that the MMU’s page-table walks result in caching page-table pages in the shared last-level cache (LLC). As a result, an attacker can derandomize virtual addresses of a victim’s code and data by locating the cache lines that store the page-table entries used for address translation. Relying only on basic memory accesses allows AnC to be implemented in JavaScript without any specific instructions or software features. We show our JavaScript implementation can break code and heap ASLR in two major browsers running on the latest Linux operating system with 28 bits of entropy in 150 seconds. We further verify that the AnC attack is applicable to every modern architecture that we tried, including Intel, ARM and AMD. Mitigating this attack without naively disabling caches is hard, since it targets the low-level operations of the MMU. We conclude that ASLR is fundamentally flawed in sandboxed environments such as JavaScript and future defenses should not rely on randomized virtual addresses as a building block.",

We show that this PCD Laplace (Point-Cloud Data Laplace) operator converges to the Laplace-Beltrami operator on the underlying manifold as the point cloud becomes denser. Unlike the previous work, we do not assume that the data samples are independent identically distributed from a probability distribution and do not require a global mesh. The resulting algorithm is easy to implement. We present experimental results indicating that even for point sets sampled from a uniform distribution, PCD Laplace converges faster than the weighted graph Laplacian. We also show that using our PCD Laplacian we can directly estimate certain geometric invariants, such as manifold area.",

Then we empirically investigate the security of searchable encryption by providing query recovery and plaintext recovery attacks that exploit these leakage profiles.

First, as is true for many discussions about risk, basic vocabulary such as \"risk,\" \"threat,\" and \"vulnerability\" are often used as if they were interchangeable, without regard to their respective definitions. Second, not every issue that's raised is really specific to cloud computing. We can achieve an accurate understanding of the security issue \"delta\" that cloud computing really adds by analyzing how cloud computing influences each risk factor. One important factor concerns vulnerabilities: cloud computing makes certain well-understood vulnerabilities more significant and adds new vulnerabilities. Here, the authors define four indicators of cloud-specific vulnerabilities, introduce a security-specific cloud reference architecture, and provide examples of cloud-specific vulnerabilities for each architectural component.",

Constructions of such schemes are currently known only for certain classes of predicates.We construct a scheme for predicates corresponding to the evaluation of inner products over ℤN (for some large integer N).

      "abstract": "Group signatures are a central cryptographic primitive where users can anonymously and accountably sign messages in the name of a group they belong to. Several efficient constructions with security proofs in the standard model i.e., without the random oracle idealization appeared in the recent years. However, like standard PKIs, group signatures need an efficient revocation system to be practical. Despite years of research, membership revocation remains a non-trivial problem: many existing solutions do not scale well due to either high overhead or constraining operational requirements like the need for all users to update their keys after each revocation. Only recently, Libert, Peters and Yung Eurocrypt'12 suggested a new scalable revocation method, based on the Naor-Naor-Lotspiech NNL broadcast encryption framework, that interacts nicely with techniques for building group signatures in the standard model. While promising, their mechanism introduces important storage requirements at group members. Namely, membership certificates, which used to have constant size in existing standard model constructions, now have polylog size in the maximal cardinality of the group NNL, after all, is a tree-based technique and such dependency is naturally expected. In this paper we show how to obtain private keys of constant size. To this end, we introduce a new technique to leverage the NNL subset cover framework in the context of group signatures but, perhaps surprisingly, without logarithmic relationship between the size of private keys and the group cardinality. Namely, we provide a way for users to efficiently prove their membership of one of the generic subsets in the NNL subset cover framework. This technique makes our revocable group signatures competitive with ordinary group signatures i.e., without revocation in the standard model. Moreover, unrevoked members as in PKIs still do not need to update their keys at each revocation.",

      "abstract": "An interactive proof system (or argument) (P, V) is concurrent zero-knowledge if whenever the prover engages in polynomially many concurrent executions of (P, V), with (possibly distinct) colluding polynomial time bounded verifiers V 1.....,V poly(n), the entire undertaking is zero-knowledge. Dwork, Naor, and Sahai recently showed the existence of a large class of concurrent zero-knowledge arguments, including arguments for all of NP, under a reasonable assumption on the behavior of clocks of nonfaulty processors. In this paper, we continue the study of concurrent zero-knowledge arguments. After observing that, without recourse to timing, the existence of a trusted center considerably simplifies the design and proof of many concurrent zero-knowledge arguments (again including arguments for all of NP), we design a preprocessing protocol, making use of timing, to simulate the trusted center for the purposes of achieving concurrent zero-knowledge. Once a particular prover and verifier have executed the preprocessing protocol, any polynomial number of subsequent executions of a rich class of protocols will be concurrent zero-knowledge.",

      "abstract": "Rather than use a shared key directly to cryptographically process (e.g. encrypt or authenticate) data one can use it as a master key to derive subkeys, and use the subkeys for the actual cryptographic processing. This popular paradigm is called re-keying, and the expectation is that it is good for security. In this paper we provide concrete security analyses of various re-keying mechanisms and their usage. We show that re-keying does indeed \"increase\" security, effectively extending the lifetime of the master key and bringing significant, provable security gains in practical situations. We quantify the security provided by different rekeying processes as a function of the security of the primitives they use, thereby enabling a user to choose between different re-keying processes given the constraints of some application.",

In the first stage (the randomized stage), the algorithm randomly selects O(k log k) columns according to a judiciously-chosen probability distribution that depends on information in the top-k right singular subspace of A. In the second stage (the deterministic stage), the algorithm applies a deterministic column-selection procedure to select and return exactly k columns from the set of columns selected in the first stage.

      "abstract": "This document should be viewed less as a first draft of a standard for public-key encryption, and more as a proposal for what such a draft standard should contain. It is hoped that this proposal will serve as a basis for discussion, from which a consensus for a standard may be formed. Summary of Changes from version 1.1 (February 13, 2001) to version 2.0 (September 17, 2001) • Some new and quite severe criticisms of the security of ECIES in certain modes of operation have been added. Specifically, it is shown that in certain modes of operation, the scheme is malleable in a very strong and quite non-trivial sense. See §15 and in particular §15.6.4. • The implementation of “cofactor mode” for ECIES is now based on the notion of “compatible cofactor mode” in IEEE P1363a, and the “old cofactor mode” is no longer recommended. See §15 as well as §15.6.5. • A new “primitive” called a data encapsulation mechanism has been introduced (see §4). This primitive was implicit in previous versions, but now it has been made explicit. This is mainly just a conceptual change. Note, however, that there is one slight change in the recommended implementation of the primitive (which we call DEM1); namely, the way in which the length of the label is formatted when passed to the MAC. This is done so as to align with IEEE P1363a. This change affects ECIES, as well as other hybrid schemes. See §10. • A new section has been added that details all the differences between our recommended version of ECIES and that recommended in the IEEE P1363a standard. Note that our recommended version of ECIES is consistent with the IEEE P1363a version — the only differences between the two are that our recommended version does not allow several options and modes of operations allowed by the IEEE P1363a version. See §15.6. • Two changes were made to ACE-KEM (formerly ACE-Encrypt ′). First, the value of v is now encoded in the ciphertext using the group encoding function, rather than the partial encoding function as in previous versions. This was done mainly for aesthetic reasons. Second, the implementation of “cofactor mode” has been changed to align with the IEEE P1363a notion of “compatible cofactor mode.” See §17. • It is now recommended that all Diffie-Hellman-based schemes use prime order subgroups. This is done mainly for alignment with other standards, as well overall consistency. • Following discussions in Santa Barbara, this report now recommends inclusion of EPOC-2 in the standard, although this report does not yet include a detailed specification of EPOC-2. • A new final section has been added that recommends the next steps to be taken toward an ISO standard. See §21. • A number of names have been changed. Some of these name changes were suggested by working group members, while others were made to increase overall consistency. old name new name ECIES ′ ECIES-KEM PSEC-2 ′ PSEC-KEM ACE-Encrypt ′ ACE-KEM Simple RSA RSA-KEM EME-OAEP OAEP-EME XEME-OAEP+ OAEP+XEME • A number of other, essentially aesthetic, changes.",

      "abstract": "Traceability schemes allow detection of at least one traitor when a group of colluders attempt to construct a pirate decoder and gain illegal access to digital content.Fiat and Tassa proposed dynamic traitor tracing schemes that can detect all traitors if they attempt to rebroadcast the content after it is decrypted.In their scheme the content is broken into segments and marked so that a re-broadcasted segment can be linked to a particular subgroup of users.Mark allocation for a segment is determined when the re-broadcast from the previous segment is observed.They showed that by careful design of the mark allocation scheme it is possible to detect all traitors. \n \nWe consider the same scenario as Fiat and Tassa and propose a new type of traceability scheme, called sequential traitor tracing, that can efficiently detect all traitors and does not require any real-time computation. That is, the marking allocation is pre-determined and is independent of the re-broadcasted segment.This is very attractive as it allows segments to be shortened and hence the overall convergence time reduced. We analyse the scheme and give two general constructions one based on a special type of function family, and the other on error correcting codes. We obtain the convergence time of these schemes and show that the scheme based on error correcting codes has a convergence time which is the same as the best known result for dynamic schemes.",

These interests and preferences are then used for selecting ads to present to the user. There is great concern that behavioral advertising in its present form infringes on user privacy. The resulting public debate — which includes consumer advocacy organizations, professional associations, and government agencies — is premised on the notion that OBA and privacy are inherently in conflict.In this paper we propose a practical architecture that enables targeting without compromising user privacy. Behavioral profiling and targeting in our system takes place in the user’s browser. We discuss the effectiveness of the system as well as potential social engineering and web-based attacks on the architecture. One complication is billing; ad-networks must bill the correct advertiser without knowing which ad was displayed to the user. We propose an efficient cryptographic billing system that directly solves the problem. We implemented the core targeting system as a Firefox extension and report on its effectiveness.",

This provable security of the Diffie-Hellman protocol over elliptic curves demonstrates an additional advantage of elliptic curve cryptosystems over conventional ones.

The prisoners, on the other hand, are willing to accept these conditions, i.e., to accept some risk of deception in order to be able to communicate at all, since they need to coordinate their plans. To do this they will have to deceive the warden by finding a way of communicating secretly in the exchanges, i.e., of establishing a “subliminal channel” between them in full view of the warden, even though the messages themselves contain no secret (to the warden) information‡.

      "abstract": "Coding theory addresses the design and analysis of codes that enable communication over noisy channels. Two types of channels that have been extensively considered are the binary symmetric channel and the adversarial channel. In a binary symmetric channel each bit of the sent message is flipped independently with some probability p, implying that the noise imposed by the channel is random in nature where the amount of noise is determined by p. In an adversarial channel the message is treated as a whole, and the noise may be an arbitrary (and malicious) function of the message being sent, as long as it does not effect more that a certain fraction (say p) of the bits transmitted. Roughly speaking, any code designed for an adversarial channel can be used on a corresponding binary symmetric channel successfully, whereas the contrary is not necessarily true. In this work we present a construction that transforms the best codes for binary symmetric channels into \"codes\" for corresponding adversarial channels. The \"codes\" we present assume that the sender and the receiver of the message have a joint secret random string (which is not known to the channel). These codes are referred to as private codes. Intuitively, this private randomness allows a reduction between the random and adversarial channels. Such a reduction is simple once the size of the joint random string is /spl Theta/(n log n) (here the codes are a subset of {0,1 }/sup n/). In this work we present private codes in which the size of the joint random string is O(log n). Moreover, we show that our result is tight. Namely, to design private codes that allow communication over adversarial channels that meet the bounds achievable when communicating over binary symmetric channels, an amount of /spl Omega/(log n) shared random bits are required. To the best of our knowledge, no prior results of this nature have been presented in the past. As part of our proof we establish a connection between list decodable codes and private codes which complements a recent result of Guruswami (CCC '03) on list decoding with side information.",

      "abstract": "We consider the task of secure multi-party computation of arithmetic circuits over a finite field. Unlike Boolean circuits, arithmetic circuits allow natural computations on integers to be expressed easily and efficiently. In the strongest setting of malicious security with a dishonest majority --- where any number of parties may deviate arbitrarily from the protocol --- most existing protocols require expensive public-key cryptography for each multiplication in the preprocessing stage of the protocol, which leads to a high total cost. We present a new protocol that overcomes this limitation by using oblivious transfer to perform secure multiplications in general finite fields with reduced communication and computation. Our protocol is based on an arithmetic view of oblivious transfer, with careful consistency checks and other techniques to obtain malicious security at a cost of less than 6 times that of semi-honest security. We describe a highly optimized implementation together with experimental results for up to five parties. By making extensive use of parallelism and SSE instructions, we improve upon previous runtimes for MPC over arithmetic circuits by more than 200 times.",

Since a block cipher may be viewed as a pseudorandom permutation, we are led to investigate the reverse of the problem studied by Luby and Rackoff, and ask: “how can one transform a PRP into a PRF in as security-preserving a way as possible?” The solution we propose is data- dependent re- keying. As an illustrative special case, let E: {0, 1}n x {0, 1}n → {0, 1}n be the block cipher. Then we can construct the PRF F from the PRP E by setting F(k, x) = E(E(k, x), x). We generalize this to allow for arbitrary block and key lengths, and to improve efficiency. We prove strong quantitative bounds on the value of data-dependent re-keying in the Shannon model of an ideal cipher, and take some initial steps towards an analysis in the standard model.",

      "abstract": "Abstract. This work develops a novel approach to hide the senders and the receivers of messages. The intuition is taken from an everyday activity that hides the ``communication pattern''—the public transportation system. To describe our protocols, buses are used as a metaphor: Buses, i.e., messages, are traveling on the network, each piece of information is allocated a seat within the bus. Routes are chosen and buses are scheduled to traverse these routes. Deterministic and randomized protocols are presented, the protocols differ in the number of buses in the system, the worst case traveling time, and the required buffer size in a ``station.'' In particular, a protocol that is based on cluster partition of the network is presented; in this protocol there is one bus traversing each cluster. The clusters' size in the partition gives time and communication tradeoffs. One advantage of our protocols over previous works is that they are not based on statistical properties for the communication pattern. Another advantage is that they only require the processors in the communication network to be busy periodically.\n",

We give an algorithm that is 4-competitive forthroughput and O(1)-competitive for the energy used. Thisimproves upon the 14 throughput competitive algorithm of Chan etal. [10]. Our throughput guarantee is optimal as any onlinealgorithm must be at least 4-competitive even if the energy concernis ignored [7].

We give a 4-competitive algorithm to minimizetotal flow time plus energy for unweighted unit size jobs, and a (2+ o(1)) α/ln α-competitivealgorithm to minimize fractional weighted flow time plus energy.Prior to our work, these guarantees were known only when theprocessor speed was unbounded (T= ∞) [4].",

      "abstract": "Current static analysis techniques for Android applications operate at the Java level—that is, they analyze either the Java source code or the Dalvik bytecode. However, Android allows developers to write code in C or C++ that is cross-compiled to multiple binary architectures. Furthermore, the Java-written components and the native code components (C or C++) can interact. Native code can access all of the Android APIs that the Java code can access, as well as alter the Dalvik Virtual Machine, thus rendering static analysis techniques for Java unsound or misleading. In addition, malicious apps frequently hide their malicious functionality in native code or use native code to launch kernel exploits. It is because of these security concerns that previous research has proposed native code sandboxing, as well as mechanisms to enforce security policies in the sandbox. However, it is not clear whether the large-scale adoption of these mechanisms is practical: is it possible to define a meaningful security policy that can be imposed by a native code sandbox without breaking app functionality? In this paper, we perform an extensive analysis of the native code usage in 1.2 million Android apps. We first used static analysis to identify a set of 446k apps potentially using native code, and we then analyzed this set using dynamic analysis. This analysis demonstrates that sandboxing native code with no permissions is not ideal, as apps’ native code components perform activities that require Android permissions. However, our analysis provided very encouraging insights that make us believe that sandboxing native code can be feasible and useful in practice. In fact, it was possible to automatically generate a native code sandboxing policy, which is derived from our analysis, that limits many malicious behaviors while still allowing the correct execution of the behavior witnessed during dynamic analysis for 99.77% of the benign apps in our dataset. The usage of our system to generate policies would reduce the attack surface available to native code and, as a further benefit, it would also enable more reliable static analysis of Java code.",

But in opposition to ordinary Petri nets q may be either the number I or an arbitrary place p of the net. If q = I, as in the case of a Petri net, firing the transition means~ that one token has to be moved from or to the place. But if q is a place p, then the number of tokens to be moved equals the actual number of tokens in p and thus depends on the actual marking. If for an actual marking M we define n := IF qEP THEN M(q) ELSE q and substitute q by n, we obtain a Petri net and the firing rule for that marking is defined as usually. Therefore a self-modifying net is a Petri net, which is able to modify its own firing rules. Bounded models of such nets have been used to simulate national economic systems /Fu/.",

A number of studies have been conducted on designing public-key schemes using the MQ problem, which are known as multivariate public-key cryptography (MPKC). However, the security of the existing schemes in MPKC relies not only on the MQ problem but also on an Isomorphism of Polynomials (IP) problem. In this paper, we propose public-key identification schemes based on the conjectured intractability of the MQ problem under the assumption of the existence of a non-interactive commitment scheme. Our schemes do not rely on the IP problem, and they consist of an identification protocol which is zeroknowledge argument of knowledge for the MQ problem. For a practical parameter choice, the efficiency of our schemes is highly comparable to that of identification schemes based on another problem including Permuted Kernels, Syndrome Decoding, Constrained Linear Equations, and Permuted Perceptrons. Furthermore, even if the protocol is repeated in parallel, our scheme can achieve the security under active attack with some additional cost.",

We show how to construct non-interactive NM commitments that remain non-malleable even if the adversary has access to an arbitrary number of commitments from honest players - rather than one, as in several previous schemes. We show this is a strictly stronger security notion. Our construction is the first non-interactive scheme achieving this that can be based on the minimal assumption of existence of one-way functions. But it can also be instantiated in a very efficient version based on the strong RSA assumption. For UC commitments, we show that existence of a UC commitment scheme in the CRS model (interactive or not) implies key exchange and - for a uniform reference string - even implies oblivious transfer. This indicates that UC commitment is a strictly stronger primitive than NM. Finally, we show that our strong RSA based construction can be used to improve the most efficient known UC commitment scheme so it can work with a CRS of size independent of the number of players, without loss of efficiency.",

In this work, we show that, while the function proposed by Micciancio is not collision resistant, it can be easily modified to achieve collision resistance under essentially the same complexity assumptions on cyclic lattices. Our modified function is obtained as a special case of a more general result, which yields efficient collision-resistant hash functions based on the worst-case hardness of various new problems.

      "abstract": "Recently, researchers have been working toward the development of practical general-purpose protocols for verifiable computation. These protocols enable a computationally weak verifier to offload computations to a powerful but untrusted prover, while providing the verifier with a guarantee that the prover performed the computations correctly. Despite substantial progress, existing implementations are not yet practical. The main bottleneck is typically the extra effort required by the prover to return an answer with a guarantee of correctness, compared to returning an answer with no guarantee. \nWe describe a refinement of a powerful interactive proof protocol originally due to Goldwasser, Kalai, and Rothblum. Cormode, Mitzenmacher, and Thaler show how to implement the prover in this protocol in time O(S log S), where S is the size of an arithmetic circuit computing the function of interest. Our refinements apply to circuits whose wiring pattern is sufficiently \"regular\"; for these circuits, we bring the runtime of the prover down to O(S). That is, our prover can evaluate the circuit with a guarantee of correctness, with only a constant-factor blowup in work compared to evaluating the circuit with no guarantee. \nWe argue that our refinements capture a large class of circuits, and prove some theorems formalizing this. Experimentally, our refinements yield a 200x speedup for the prover over the implementation of Cormode et al., and our prover is less than 10x slower than a C++ program that simply evaluates the circuit. Along the way, we describe a special-purpose protocol for matrix multiplication that is of interest in its own right. \nOur final contribution is a protocol targeted at general data parallel computation. Compared to prior work, this protocol can more efficiently verify complicated computations as long as that computation is applied independently to many pieces of data.",

Meeting of such units is likely to be a basic procedure in the area of distributed “intelligent agent” computing and in the domain of coordinated tasks of autonomous robots. The crux of the problem which we present here and initiate research on, is the breaking of potential symmetry while the units dynamically move. The units are more intelligent (computing power, control and memory) than simple (traditional) pebbles or tokens, and our algorithms will make use of this capability for speeding up the convergence to a common place (e.g., we will allow units to meet exchange information and depart). We consider both randomized protocols and deterministic (but non-uniform) protocols; the problem is unsolvable by a uniform deterministic algorithm. The deterministic procedure employs ideas from design theory and achieves O(n) time, while the randomized methods are based on random walks and may achieve O(n) time where k is the number of agents.",

In real life, however, the black box approach is not sufficient because attackers have access to many physical means that enable them to derive information on the secret keys. In order to limit the attacker’s ability to read out secret information, the concept of Algorithmic Tamper Proof (ATP) security is needed as put forth by Gennaro, Lysyanskaya, Malkin, Micali and Rabin. An essential component to achieve ATP security is read-proof hardware. In this paper, we develop an implementation of read-proof hardware that is resistant against invasive attacks. The construction is based on a hardware and a cryptographic part. The hardware consists of a protective coating that contains a lot of randomness. By performing measurements on the coating a fingerprint is derived. The cryptographic part consists of a Fuzzy Extractor that turns this fingerprint into a secure key. Hence no key is present in the non-volatile memory of the device. It is only constructed at the time when needed, and deleted afterwards. A practical implementation of the hardware and the cryptographic part is given. Finally, experimental evidence is given that an invasive attack on an IC equipped with this coating, reveals only a small amount of information on the key.",

Our software for the AVR takes only 13,900,397 cycles for the computation of a Diffie–Hellman shared secret, and is the first to perform this computation in less than a second if clocked at 16 MHz for a security level of 128 bits. Our MSP430X software computes a shared secret in 5,301,792 cycles on MSP430X microcontrollers that have a 32-bit hardware multiplier and in 7,933,296 cycles on MSP430X microcontrollers that have a 16-bit multiplier. It thus outperforms previous constant-time ECDH software at the 128-bit security level on the MSP430X by more than a factor of 1.2 and 1.15, respectively. Our implementation on the Cortex-M0 runs in only 3,589,850 cycles and outperforms previous 128-bit secure ECDH software by a factor of 3.",

      "abstract": "The famous Leftover Hash Lemma (LHL) states that (almost) universal hash functions are good randomness extractors. Despite its numerous applications, LHL-based extractors suffer from the following two limitations: - Large Entropy Loss: to extract v bits from distribution X of minentropy m which are e-close to uniform, one must set v ≤ m - 2 log (1/e), meaning that the entropy loss L = m - v ≥ 2 log (1/e). For many applications, such entropy loss is too large. - Large Seed Length: the seed length n of (almost) universal hash function required by the LHL must be at least n ≥ min(u - v, v + 2 log (1/e) - O(1), where u is the length of the source, and must grow with the number of extracted bits. \n \nQuite surprisingly, we show that both limitations of the LHL - large entropy loss and large seed - can be overcome (or, at least, mitigated) in various important scenarios. First, we show that entropy loss could be reduced to L = log(1/e) for the setting of deriving secret keys for a wide range of cryptographic applications. Specifically, the security of these schemes with an LHL-derived key gracefully degrades from e to at most e + √e2-L. (Notice that, unlike standard LHL, this bound is meaningful even when one extracts more bits than the min-entropy we have!) Based on these results we build a general computational extractor that enjoys low entropy loss and can be used to instantiate a generic key derivation function for any cryptographic application. \n \nSecond, we study the soundness of the natural expand-then-extract approach, where one uses a pseudorandom generator (PRG) to expand a short \"input seed\" S into a longer \"output seed\" S', and then use the resulting S' as the seed required by the LHL (or, more generally, by any randomness extractor). We show that, in general, the expandthen-extract approach is not sound if the Decisional Diffie-Hellman assumption is true. Despite that, we show that it is sound either: (1) when extracting a \"small\" (logarithmic in the security of the PRG) number of bits; or (2) in minicrypt. Implication (2) suggests that the expandthen-extract approach is likely secure when used with \"practical\" PRGs, despite lacking a reductionist proof of security!",

      "abstract": "Malware remains one of the most significant secu- rity threats on the Internet. Antivirus solutions and blacklists, the main weapons of defense against these attacks, have only been (partially) successful. One reason is that cyber-criminals take active steps to bypass defenses, for example, by distribut- ing constantly changing (obfuscated) variants of their malware programs, and by quickly churning through domains and IP addresses that are used for distributing exploit code and botnet commands. We analyze one of the core tasks that malware authors have to achieve to be successful: They must distribute and install malware programs onto as many victim machines as possible. A main vec- tor to accomplish this is through drive-by download attacks where victims are lured onto web pages that launch exploits against the users' web browsers and their components. Once an exploit is successful, the injected shellcode automatically downloads and launches the malware program. While a significant amount of previous work has focused on detecting the drive-by exploit step and the subsequent network traffic produced by malware programs, little attention has been paid to the intermediate step where the malware binary is downloaded. In this paper, we study how clients in real-world networks download and install malware, and present Nazca, a system that detects infections in large scale networks. Nazca does not operate on individual connections, nor looks at properties of the downloaded programs or the reputation of the servers hosting them. Instead, it looks at the telltale signs of the malicious network infrastructures that orchestrate these malware installa- tion that become apparent when looking at the collective traffic produced and becomes apparent when looking at the collective traffic produced by many users in a large network. Being content agnostic, Nazca does not suffer from coverage gaps in reputation databases (blacklists), and is not susceptible to code obfuscation. We have run Nazca on seven days of traffic from a large Internet Service Provider, where it has detected previously-unseen malware with very low false positive rates",

      "abstract": "Many natural combinatorial problems can be expressed as constraint satisfaction problems. This class of problems is known to be NP-complete in general, but certain restrictions on the form of the constraints can ensure tractability. In this paper we show that any restricted set of constraint types can be associated with a finite universal algebra. We explore how the computational complexity of a restricted constraint satisfaction problem is connected to properties of the corresponding algebra. Using these results we exhibit a common structural property of all known intractable constraint satisfaction problems. Finally, we classify all finite strictly simple surjective algebras with respect to tractability. The result is a dichotomy theorem which significantly generalises Schaefer's dichotomy for the Generalised Satisfiability problem.",

This class includes the multiplication of matrice% polynomials, quaternions, Cayley and complex numbers. Considering bilinear algorithms, the optimal number of non-scalar multiplications can be described as the rank of a three-tensor or as the smallest number of rank one matrices necessary to include a given set of matrices in their span. In this paper, we attack a rather large subclass of three-tensors, namely that of (p, q, 2) tensors, for arbitrary p and q , and solve it completely. The complexity of a general pair of bilinear forms is determined explicitly in terms of parameters related to Kronecker's theory of pencils and to the theory of invariant polynomial~ This reveals unexpected results and shows explicitly the dependence on the algebraic structure of the constants; we display, for example, a pair of n x n bilinear forms whose complexity is n + 1 over infinite fields and which, however, requires exactly multiplications over a finite field with cardinality k. Another consequence of our results is that any set of m, p x q , bilinear forms require at most m . ~)) ~(mln(p + ~, q + multiplications over any field.",

      "abstract": "The braid group with its conjugacy problem is one of the recent hot issues in cryptography. At CT-RSA 2001, Anshel, Anshel, Fisher, and Goldfeld proposed a commutator key agreement protocol (KAP) based on the braid groups and their colored Burau representation. Its security is based on the multiple simultaneous conjugacy problem (MSCP) plus a newly adopted key extractor. This article shows how to reduce finding the shared key of this KAP to the list-MSCPs in a permutation group and in a matrix group over a finite field. We also develop a mathematical algorithm for the MSCP in braid groups. The former implies that the usage of colored Burau representation in the key extractor causes a new weakness, and the latter can be used as a tool to investigate the security level of their KAP.",

      "abstract": "Software monocultures are usually considered dangerous because their size and uniformity represent the potential for costly and widespread damage. The emerging concept of collaborative security provides the opportunity to re-examine the utility of software monoculture by exploiting the homogeneity and scale that typically define large software monocultures. Monoculture can be leveraged to improve an application’s overall security and reliability. We introduce and explore the concept of Application Communities: collections of large numbers of independent instances of the same application. Members of an application community share the burden of monitoring for flaws and attacks, and notify the rest of the community when such are detected. Appropriate mitigation mechanisms are then deployed against the newly discovered fault. We explore the concept of an application community and determine its feasibility through analytical modeling and a prototype implementation focusing on software faults and vulnerabilities. Specifically, we identify a set of parameters that define application communities and explore the tradeoffs between the minimal size of an application community, the marginal overhead imposed on each member, and the speed with which new faults are detected and isolated. We demonstrate the feasibility of the scheme using Selective Transactional EMulation (STEM) as both the monitoring and remediation mechanism for low-level software faults, and provide some preliminary experimental results using the Apache web server as the protected application. Our experiments show that ACs are practical and feasible for current applications: an AC of 15,000 members can collaboratively monitor Apache for new faults and immunize all members against them with only a 6% performance degradation for each member.",

      "abstract": "We initiate the study of graph sketching, i.e., algorithms that use a limited number of linear measurements of a graph to determine the properties of the graph. While a graph on n nodes is essentially O(n2)-dimensional, we show the existence of a distribution over random projections into d-dimensional \"sketch\" space (d<< n2) such that the relevant properties of the original graph can be inferred from the sketch with high probability. Specifically, we show that: \n \n1. d = O(n · polylog n) suffices to evaluate properties including connectivity, k-connectivity, bipartiteness, and to return any constant approximation of the weight of the minimum spanning tree. \n \n2. d = O(n1+γ) suffices to compute graph sparsifiers, the exact MST, and approximate the maximum weighted matchings if we permit O(1/γ)-round adaptive sketches, i.e., a sequence of projections where each projection may be chosen dependent on the outcome of earlier sketches. \n \nOur results have two main applications, both of which have the potential to give rise to fruitful lines of further research. First, our results can be thought of as giving the first compressed-sensing style algorithms for graph data. Secondly, our work initiates the study of dynamic graph streams. There is already extensive literature on processing massive graphs in the data-stream model. However, the existing work focuses on graphs defined by a sequence of inserted edges and does not consider edge deletions. We think this is a curious omission given the existing work on both dynamic graphs in the non-streaming setting and dynamic geometric streaming. Our results include the first dynamic graph semi-streaming algorithms for connectivity, spanning trees, sparsification, and matching problems.",

Applications of AONTs include improving the security and speed of encryption. We give several formal definitions of security for AONTs that are stronger and more suited to practical applications than the original definitions. We then prove that Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding (OAEP) satisfies these definitions (in the random oracle model). This is the first construction of an AONT that has been proven secure in the strong sense. Our bound on the adversary's advantage is nearly optimal, in the sense that no adversary can do substantially better against the OAEP than by exhaustive search.

Our study provides formal foundations to explore the tradeoffs underlying the design of accountability systems including: the power of the auditor, the efficiency of the audit protocol, the requirements placed on the agents, and the requirements placed on the communication infrastructure.",

Besides a thorough theoretical analysis of the DPA-resistance of masked gates in the presence of glitches, we also provide simulation results that confirm the theoretical elaborations. Glitches occur in every CMOS circuit. Consequently, the currently known masking schemes for CMOS gates do not prevent DPA attacks.",

The size of the MAC tags in this construction is optimal, i.e., exactly twice the size of the block cipher. Up to a constant, the security of the proposed randomized CBC-MAC using an n-bit block cipher is the same as the security of the usual encrypted CBC-MAC using a 2n-bit block cipher. Moreover, this construction adds a negligible computational overhead compared to the cost of a plain, non-randomized CBC-MAC. We give a full standard proof of our construction using one pass of a block-cipher with 2n-bit keys but there also is a proof for n-bit keys block-ciphers in the random oracle model.",

Using hard lattice problems, such as the shortest vector problem, as the basis of security has advantages over using the factoring or discrete logarithm problems. For instance, lattice operations are more efficient than modular exponentiation and lattice problems remain hard for quantum and subexponential-time adversaries. Generally speaking, BS allow a signer to sign a message without seeing it, while retaining a certain amount of control over the process. In particular, the signer can control the number of issued signatures. For the receiver of the signature, this process provides perfect anonymity, e.g., his spendings remain anonymous when using BS for electronic money.",

Our work particularly focuses on the challenging requirement that the third party should be able to verify the validity with respect to the specific data authenticated by the source -- even without having access to that source. This problem is motivated by various scenarios emerging from several application areas such as wearable computing, smart metering, or general business-to-business interactions. Furthermore, these applications also demand any meaningful solution to satisfy additional properties related to usability and scalability. In this paper, we formalize the above three-party model, discuss concrete application scenarios, and then we design, build, and evaluate ADSNARK, a nearly practical system for proving arbitrary computations over authenticated data in a privacy-preserving manner. ADSNARK improves significantly over state-of-the-art solutions for this model. For instance, compared to corresponding solutions based on Pinocchio (Oakland'13), ADSNARK achieves up to 25x improvement in proof-computation time and a 20x reduction in prover storage space.",

Eureka provides several Windows API resolution techniques that identify system calls in the unpacked code by overcoming various existing control flow obfuscations. Eureka's unpacking and API resolution capabilities facilitate the structural analysis of the underlying malware logic by means of micro-ontology generation that labels groupings of identified API calls based on their functionality. They enable a visual means for understanding malware code through the automated construction of annotated control flow and call graphs.Our evaluation on multiple datasets reveals that Eureka can simplify analysis on a large fraction of contemporary Internet malware by successfully unpacking and deobfuscating API references.",

      "abstract": "Recently a new class of collision attacks which was originally suggested by Hans Dobbertin has been introduced. These attacks use side channel analysis to detect internal collisions and are generally not restricted to a particular cryptographic algorithm. As an example, a collision attack against DES was proposed which combines internal collisions with side channel information leakage. It had not been obvious, however, how this attack applies to non-Feistel ciphers with bijective S-boxes such as the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). This contribution takes the same basic ideas and develops new optimized attacks against AES. Our major finding is that the new combined analytical and side channel approach reduces the attack effort compared to all other known side channel attacks. We develop several versions and refinements of the attack. First we show that key dependent collisions can be caused in the output bytes of the mix column transformation in the first round. By taking advantage of the birthday paradox, it is possible to cause a collision in an output with as little as 20 measurements. If a SPA leak is present from which collisions can be determined with certainty, then each collision will reveal at least 8 bits of the secret key. Furthermore, in an optimized attack, it is possible to cause collisions in all four output bytes of the mix column transformation with an average of only 31 measurements, which results in knowledge of all 32 key bits. Finally, if collisions are caused in all four columns of the AES in parallel, it is possible to determine the entire 128-bit key with only 40 measurements, which a is a distinct improvement compared to DPA and other side channel attacks.",

For example, a linear-time algorithm is given for the classical problem of finding the smallest circle enclosing n given points in the plane; this disproves a conjecture by Shamos and Hoey [Proc. 16th IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science, 1975] that this problem requires lq(n log n) time. An immediate consequence of the main result is that the problem of linear separability is solvable in linear time. This corrects an error in Shamos and Hoey’s paper, namely, that their O(n log n) algorithm for this problem in the plane was optimal. Also, a linear-time algorithm is given for the problem of finding the weighted center of a tree, and algorithms for other common location-theoretic problems are indicated. The results apply also to the problem of convex quadratic programming in three dimensions. The results have already been extended to higher dimensions, and we know that linear programming can be solved in linear time when the dimension is fixed. This will be reported elsewhere; a preliminary version is available from the author.

We derive a new security proof for PSS in which a much shorter random salt is used to achieve the same security level, namely we show that log2 qsig bits suffice, where qsig is the number of signature queries made by the attacker. When PSS is used with message recovery, a better bandwidth is obtained because longer messages can now be recovered. In this paper, we also introduce a new technique for proving that the security proof of a signature scheme is optimal. In particular, we show that the size of the random salt that we have obtained for PSS is optimal: if less than log2 qsig bits are used, then PSS is still provably secure but it cannot have a tight security proof. Our technique applies to other signature schemes such as the Full Domain Hash scheme and Gennaro-Halevi-Rabin's scheme, whose security proofs are shown to be optimal.",

The distinguishing characteristic of chameleon signatures is that their are non-transferable, with only the designated recipient capable of asserting its validity. In this paper, we introduce the first identity-based chameleon hash function. The general advantages of identity-based cryptography over conventional schemes relative to key distribution are even more pronounced in a chameleon hashing scheme, because the owner of a public key does not necessarily need to retrieve the associated secret key. We use the identity-based chameleon hashing scheme to build the id-based chameleon signature and a novel sealed-bid auction scheme that is robust, communication efficient (bidders send a single message), and secure under a particular trust model.",

This model includes as important special cases Weak Oblivious Transfer (WOT), where both the sender and receiver may learn too much about the other party's input, and a new, more realistic model of noisy channels, called unfair noisy channels. An unfair noisy channel has a known range of possible noise levels; protocols must work for any level within this range against adversaries who know the actual noise level. \n \nWe give a precise characterization for when one can base OT on WOT. When the deviation of the WOT from the ideal is above a certain threshold, we show that no information-theoretic reductions from OT (even against passive adversaries) and BC exist; when the deviation is below this threshold, we give a reduction from OT (and hence BC) that is information-theoretically secure against active adversaries. \n \nFor unfair noisy channels we show a similar threshold phenomenon for bit commitment. If the upper bound on the noise is above a threshold (given as a function of the lower bound) then no information-theoretic reduction from OT (even against passive adversaries) or BC exist; when it is below this threshold we give a reduction from BC.

In this work we resolve the main open problem and give a new reduction that works for a larger range of parameters, allowing for a polynomial modulus and modulus-to-error ratio. In particular, a smaller modulus gives us greater efficiency, and a smaller modulus-to-error ratio gives us greater security, which now follows from the worst-case hardness of GapSVP with polynomial (rather than super-polynomial) approximation factors.",

Following this work, we propose a secure client-side deduplication scheme, with the following advantages: our scheme protects data confidentiality (and some partial information) against both outside adversaries and honest-but-curious cloud storage server, while Halevi et al. trusts cloud storage server in data confidentiality; our scheme is proved secure w.r.t. any distribution with sufficient min-entropy, while Halevi et al. (the last and the most practical construction) is particular to a specific type of distribution (a generalization of \"block-fixing\" distribution) of input files.\n The cost of our improvements is that we adopt a weaker leakage setting: We allow a bounded amount one-time leakage of a target file before our scheme starts to execute, while Halevi et al. allows a bounded amount multi-time leakage of the target file before and after their scheme starts to execute. To the best of our knowledge, previous works on client-side deduplication prior Halevi et al. do not consider any leakage setting.",

The goal in question is IND-CCA-preserving asymmetric encryption which formally captures security of the most common practical usage of asymmetric encryption, namely to transport a symmetric key in such a way that symmetric encryption under the latter remains secure. The scheme is an ElGamal variant, called Hash ElGamal, that resembles numerous existing RO-model schemes, and on the surface shows no evidence of its anomalous properties. These results extend our understanding of the gap between the standard and RO models, and bring concerns raised by previous work closer to practice by indicating that the problem of RO-model schemes admitting no secure instantiation can arise in domains where RO schemes are commonly designed.",

      "abstract": "Exploits for new vulnerabilities, especially when incorporated within a fast spreading worm, can compromise nearly all vulnerable hosts within a short amount of time. This problem demonstrates the need for fast defenses which can react to a new vulnerability quickly. In addition, a realistic defense system should (a) not require source code since in practice most vulnerable systems do not have source code access nor is there adequate time to involve the software vendor, (b) be accurate, i.e., have a negligible false positive rate and low false negative rate, and (c) be efficient, i.e., add little overhead to normal program execution. We propose vulnerability-specific execution-based filtering (VSEF) – a new approach for automatic defense which achieves a lower error rate and wider applicability than input filters and has better performance than full execution monitoring. VSEF is an execution-based filter which filters out attacks on a specific vulnerability based on the vulnerable program’s execution trace. We present VSEF, along with a system for automatically creating VSEF filters and a hardened program without access to source code. In our system, the time it takes to create the filter and generate the hardened program is negligible. The overhead of the hardened program is only a few percent in most cases. The false positive rate is zero in most cases, and the hardened program is resilient against polymorphic variants of exploits on the same vulnerability. VSEF therefore achieves the required performance, accuracy, and response speed requirements to defend against current fast-spreading exploits.",

      "abstract": "We design a novel, communication-efficient, failure-robust protocol for secure aggregation of high-dimensional data. Our protocol allows a server to compute the sum of large, user-held data vectors from mobile devices in a secure manner (i.e. without learning each user's individual contribution), and can be used, for example, in a federated learning setting, to aggregate user-provided model updates for a deep neural network. We prove the security of our protocol in the honest-but-curious and active adversary settings, and show that security is maintained even if an arbitrarily chosen subset of users drop out at any time. We evaluate the efficiency of our protocol and show, by complexity analysis and a concrete implementation, that its runtime and communication overhead remain low even on large data sets and client pools. For 16-bit input values, our protocol offers $1.73 x communication expansion for 210 users and 220-dimensional vectors, and 1.98 x expansion for 214 users and 224-dimensional vectors over sending data in the clear.",

      "abstract": "Zero correlation linear cryptanalysis is a novel key recovery technique for block ciphers proposed in [5]. It is based on linear approximations with probability of exactly 1/2 (which corresponds to the zero correlation). Some block ciphers turn out to have multiple linear approximations with correlation zero for each key over a considerable number of rounds. Zero correlation linear cryptanalysis is the counterpart of impossible differential cryptanalysis in the domain of linear cryptanalysis, though having many technical distinctions and sometimes resulting in stronger attacks. \n \nIn this paper, we propose a statistical technique to significantly reduce the data complexity using the high number of zero correlation linear approximations available. We also identify zero correlation linear approximations for 14 and 15 rounds of TEA and XTEA. Those result in key-recovery attacks for 21-round TEA and 25-round XTEA, while requiring less data than the full code book. In the single secret key setting, these are structural attacks breaking the highest number of rounds for both ciphers. \n \nThe findings of this paper demonstrate that the prohibitive data complexity requirements are not inherent in the zero correlation linear cryptanalysis and can be overcome. Moreover, our results suggest that zero correlation linear cryptanalysis can actually break more rounds than the best known impossible differential cryptanalysis does for relevant block ciphers. This might make a security re-evaluation of some ciphers necessary in the view of the new attack.",

In particular, we show that balanced Boolean functions obtained by modifying and multiplying sequences achieve a nonlinearity higher than that attainable by any previously known construction method. We also present methods for constructing highly nonlinear balanced Boolean functions satisfying the propagation criterion with respect to all but one or three vectors. A technique is developed to transform the vectors where the propagation criterion is not satisfied in such a way that the functions constructed satisfy the propagation criterion of high degree while preserving the balancedness and nonlinearity of the functions. The algebraic degrees of functions constructed are also discussed, together with examples illustrating the various constructions.",

      "abstract": "Secure computation consists of protocols for secure arithmetic: secret values are added and multiplied securely by networked processors. The striking feature of secure computation is that security is maintained even in the presence of an adversary who corrupts a quorum of the processors and who exercises full, malicious control over them. One of the fundamental primitives at the heart of secure computation is secret-sharing. Typically, the required secret-sharing techniques build on Shamir's scheme, which can be viewed as a cryptographic twist on the Reed-Solomon error correcting code. In this work we further the connections between secure computation and error correcting codes. We demonstrate that threshold secure computation in the secure channels model can be based on arbitrary codes. For a network of size n, we then show a reduction in communication for secure computation amounting to a multiplicative logarithmic factor (in n) compared to classical methods for small, e.g., constant size fields, while tolerating $t players to be corrupted, where ?> 0 can be arbitrarily small. For large networks this implies considerable savings in communication. Our results hold in the broadcast/negligible error model of Rabin and Ben-Or, and complement results from CRYPTO 2006 for the zero-error model of Ben-Or, Goldwasser and Wigderson (BGW). Our general theory can be extended so as to encompass those results from CRYPTO 2006 as well. We also present a new method for constructing high information rate ramp schemes based on arbitrary codes, and in particular we give a new construction based on algebraic geometry codes.",

This bound was carried over to keyed variants of the function, such as SpongeWrap, to achieve a min {2 c/2,2 κ } security bound, with κ the key length. Similarly, many CAESAR competition submissions are designed to comply with the classical 2 c/2 security bound. We show that Sponge-based constructions for authenticated encryption can achieve the significantly higher bound of min {2 b/2,2 c ,2 κ } asymptotically, with b > c the permutation size, by proving that the CAESAR submission NORX achieves this bound. Furthermore, we show how to apply the proof to five other Sponge-based CAESAR submissions: Ascon, CBEAM/STRIBOB, ICEPOLE, Keyak, and two out of the three PRIMATEs. A direct application of the result shows that the parameter choices of these submissions are overly conservative. Simple tweaks render the schemes considerably more efficient without sacrificing security. For instance, NORX64 can increase its rate and decrease its capacity by 128 bits and Ascon-128 can encrypt three times as fast, both without affecting the security level of their underlying modes in the ideal permutation model.",

      "abstract": "Designing secure protocols in the Universal Composability (UC) framework confers many advantages. In particular, it allows the protocols to be securely used as building blocks in more complex protocols, and assists in understanding their security properties. Unfortunately, most existing models in which universally composable computation is possible (for useful functionalities) require a trusted setup stage. Recently, Katz [Eurocrypt '07] proposed an alternative to the trusted setup assumption: tamper-proof hardware. Instead of trusting a third party to correctly generate the setup information, each party can create its own hardware tokens, which it sends to the other parties. Each party is only required to trust that its own tokens are tamper-proof. \n \nKatz designed a UC commitment protocol that requires both parties to generate hardware tokens. In addition, his protocol relies on a specific number-theoretic assumption. In this paper, we construct UC commitment protocols for \"David\" and \"Goliath\": we only require a single party (Goliath) to be capable of generating tokens. We construct a version of the protocol that is secure for computationally unbounded parties, and a more efficient version that makes computational assumptions only about David (we require only the existence of a one-way function). Our protocols are simple enough to be performed by hand on David's side. \n \nThese properties may allow such protocols to be used in situations which are inherently asymmetric in real-life, especially those involving individuals versus large organizations. Classic examples include voting protocols (voters versus \"the government\") and protocols involving private medical data (patients versus insurance-agencies or hospitals).",

      "abstract": "Functional encryption supports restricted decryption keys that allow users to learn specific functions of the encrypted messages. Although the vast majority of research on functional encryption has so far focused on the privacy of the encrypted messages, in many realistic scenarios it is crucial to offer privacy also for the functions for which decryption keys are provided. Whereas function privacy is inherently limited in the public-key setting, in the private-key setting it has a tremendous potential. Specifically, one can hope to construct schemes where encryptions of messages $$\\mathsf{m}_1, \\ldots , \\mathsf{m}_T$$m1,…,mT together with decryption keys corresponding to functions $$f_1, \\ldots , f_T$$f1,…,fT, reveal essentially no information other than the values $$\\{ f_i(\\mathsf{m}_j)\\}_{i,j\\in [T]}$${fi(mj)}i,j∈[T]. Despite its great potential, the known function-private private-key schemes either support rather limited families of functions (such as inner products) or offer somewhat weak notions of function privacy. We present a generic transformation that yields a function-private functional encryption scheme, starting with any non-function-private scheme for a sufficiently rich function class. Our transformation preserves the message privacy of the underlying scheme and can be instantiated using a variety of existing schemes. Plugging in known constructions of functional encryption schemes, we obtain function-private schemes based either on the learning with errors assumption, on obfuscation assumptions, on simple multilinear-maps assumptions, and even on the existence of any one-way function (offering various trade-offs between security and efficiency).",

Dynamic k-TAA allows application providers to independently grant or revoke users from their own access group so as to provide better control over their clients. In terms of time and space complexity, existing dynamic k-TAA schemes are of complexities O(k), where k is the allowed number of authentication. In this paper, we construct a dynamic k-TAA scheme with space and time complexities of O(log(k)). We also outline how to construct dynamic k-TAA scheme with a constant proving effort. Public key size of this variant, however, is O(k). \n \nWe then construct an ordinary k-TAA scheme from the dynamic scheme. We also describe a trade-off between efficiency and setup freeness of AP, in which AP does not need to hold any secret while maintaining control over their clients. \n \nTo build our system, we modify the short group signature scheme into a signature scheme and provide efficient protocols that allow one to prove in zero-knowledge the knowledge of a signature and to obtain a signature on a committed block of messages. We prove that the signature scheme is secure in the standard model under the q-SDH assumption. \n \nFinally, we show that our dynamic k-TAA scheme, constructed from bilinear pairing, is secure in the random oracle model.",

We also develop methodology for analyzing the accuracy of such algorithms on realistic networks. \n \nThe main idea behind our techniques is to 'project' (in one of several senses) the input graph onto the set of graphs with maximum degree below a certain threshold. We design projection operators, tailored to specific statistics that have low sensitivity and preserve information about the original statistic. These operators can be viewed as giving a fractional (low-degree) graph that is a solution to an optimization problem described as a maximum flow instance, linear program, or convex program. In addition, we derive a generic, efficient reduction that allows us to apply any differentially private algorithm for bounded-degree graphs to an arbitrary graph. This reduction is based on analyzing the smooth sensitivity of the 'naive' truncation that simply discards nodes of high degree.",

      "abstract": "Over the past few years, injection vulnerabilities have become the primary target for remote exploits. SQL injection, command injection, and cross-site scripting are some of the popular attacks that exploit these vulnerabilities. Taint-tracking has emerged as one of the most promising approaches for defending against these exploits, as it supports accurate detection (and prevention) of popular injection attacks. However, practical deployment of tainttracking defenses has been hampered by a number of factors, including: (a) high performance overheads (often over 100%), (b) the need for deep instrumentation, which has the potential to impact application robustness and stability, and (c) specificity to the language in which an application is written. In order to overcome these limitations, we present a new technique in this paper called taint inference. This technique does not require any source-code or binary instrumentation of the application to be protected; instead, it operates by intercepting requests and responses from this application. For most web applications, this interception may be achieved using network layer interposition or library interposition. We then develop a class of policies called syntaxand taint-aware policies that can accurately detect and/or block most injection attacks. An experimental evaluation shows that our techniques are effective in detecting a broad range of attacks on applications written in multiple languages (including PHP, Java and C), and impose low performance overheads (below 5%).",

We characterize the uncovered limitations of indifferentiability by showing that the formalizations used thus far implicitly exclude security notions captured by experiments that have multiple, disjoint adversarial stages. Examples include deterministic public-key encryption (PKE), password-based cryptography, hash function nonmalleability, and more. We formalize a stronger notion, reset indifferentiability, that enables a composition theorem covering such multi-stage security notions, but our results show that practical hash constructions cannot be reset indifferentiable. We finish by giving direct security proofs for several important PKE schemes.",

The new entropy employment method allows an increase in the TRNG throughput by significantly reducing the required entropy accumulating time. Samples obtained from simulation of TRNG design have been evaluated using AIS.31 and FIPS 140-1/2 statistical tests. The results of these tests have proven the high quality of generated data.

Joe-E is a subset of Java that makes it easier to architect and implement programs with strong security properties that can be checked during a security review. It enables programmers to apply the principle of least privilege to their programs; implement application-specific reference monitors that cannot be bypassed; introduce and use domain-specific security abstractions; safely execute and interact with untrusted code; and build secure, extensible systems. Joe-E demonstrates how it is possible to achieve the strong security properties of an object-capability language while retaining the features and feel of a mainstream object-oriented language. Additionally, we present ways in which Java’s static type safety complements object-capability analysis and permits additional security properties to be verified statically, compared with previous object-capability languages which rely on runtime checks. In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of Joe-E and its advantages for security and auditability over standard Java. We demonstrate how Joe-E can be used to develop systems with novel security properties that would be difficult or impossible to ensure otherwise, including a web application platform that provides transparent, transactional object persistence and can safely host multiple mutually-distrustful applications in a single JVM.",

Given a branching program P and an encryption c′ of an input x, it is possible to efficiently compute a succinct ciphertext c′ from which P(x) can be efficiently decoded using the secret key. The size of c′ depends polynomially on the size of x and the length of P, but does not further depend on the size of P. As interesting special cases, one can efficiently evaluate finite automata, decision trees, and OBDDs on encrypted data, where the size of the resulting ciphertext c′ does not depend on the size of the object being evaluated. These are the first general representation models for which such a feasibility result is shown. Our main construction generalizes the approach of Kushilevitz and Ostrovsky (FOCS 1997) for constructing single-server Private Information Retrieval protocols. \n \nWe also show how to strengthen the above so that c′ does not contain additional information about P (other than P(x) for some x) even if the public key and the ciphertext c are maliciously formed. This yields a two-message secure protocol for evaluating a length-bounded branching program P held by a server on an input x held by a client. A distinctive feature of this protocol is that it hides the size of the server's input P from the client. In particular, the client's work is independent of the size of P.",

These protocols are typically analyzed with respect to three types of attacks, which are historically known as Distance Fraud, Mafia Fraud, and Terrorist Fraud. We define and analyze a fourth main type of attack on distance bounding protocols, called Distance Hijacking. This type of attack poses a serious threat in many practical scenarios. We show that many proposed distance bounding protocols are vulnerable to Distance Hijacking, and we propose solutions to make these protocols resilient to this type of attack. We show that verifying distance bounding protocols using existing informal and formal frameworks does not guarantee the absence of Distance Hijacking attacks. We extend a formal framework for reasoning about distance bounding protocols to include overshadowing attacks. We use the resulting framework to prove the absence of all of the found attacks for protocols to which our countermeasures have been applied.",

This progress shows not only the practicability of second order attacks, but also the need for provably secure countermeasures. Surprisingly, while many studies have been dedicated to the attacks, only a few papers have been published about the dedicated countermeasures. In fact, only the method proposed by Schramm and Paar at CT-RSA 2006 enables to thwart second order side channel analysis. In this paper, we introduce two new methods which constitute a worthwhile alternative to Schramm and Paar's proposal. We prove their security in a strong security model and we exhibit a way to significantly improve their efficiency by using the particularities of the targeted architectures.

These acoustic emanations are more than a nuisance: as we show in this paper, they can leak the key used in cryptographic operations. This is surprising, since the acoustic information has very low bandwidth (under 20 kHz using common microphones, and a few hundred kHz using ultrasound microphones), which is many orders of magnitude below the GHz-scale clock rates of the attacked computers. We describe a new acoustic cryptanalysis attack which can extract full 4096-bit RSA keys from the popular GnuPG software, within an hour, using the sound generated by the computer during the decryption of some chosen ciphertexts. We experimentally demonstrate such attacks, using a plain mobile phone placed next to the computer, or a more sensitive microphone placed 10 meters away.",

Further, the random oracle based schemes require updates to the secret key in order to maintain security, even when no leakage during computation is present. \n \nWe present the first signature scheme that is resilient to full continual leakage: memory leakage as well as leakage from processing during signing (both from the secret key and the randomness), in key generation, and in update. Our scheme can tolerate leakage of a 1 - o(1) fraction of the secret key between updates, and is proven secure in the standard model based on the symmetric external DDH (SXDH) assumption in bilinear groups. The time periods between updates are a function of the amount of leakage in the period (and nothing more). \n \nAs an additional technical contribution, we introduce a new tool: independent pre-image resistant hash functions, which may be of independent interest.",

The model takes into account recommendations for the trustworthiness of entities. Furthermore, it includes confidence values for statements and can exploit arbitrary certification structures containing multiple intersecting certification paths to achieve a higher confidence value than for any single certification path. Confidence values are measured on a continuous scale between 0 and 1 and, in contrast to previous work in this area, are interpreted as probabilities in a well-defined random experiment.",

The most commonly used cryptogryphic algorithm is DES (1). However, it is generally implemented with hardware, and the cost is prohibitive for small scale systems such as personal computer communications. Accordingly, an encipherment algorithm that has safety equal to DES and is suitable for software as well as hardware implementation is needed.

      "abstract": "In 1998, Blaze, Bleumer, and Strauss (BBS) proposed proxy re-signatures, in which a semi-trusted proxy acts as a translator between Alice and Bob. To translate, the proxy converts a signature from Alice into a signature from Bob on the same message. The proxy, however, does not learn any signing key and cannot sign arbitrary messages on behalf of either Alice or Bob. Since the BBS proposal, the proxy re-signature primitive has been largely ignored, but we show that it is a very useful tool for sharing web certificates, forming weak group signatures, and authenticating a network path.We begin our results by formalizing the definition of security for a proxy re-signature. We next substantiate the need for improved schemes by pointing out certain weaknesses of the original BBS proxy re-signature scheme which make it unfit for most practical applications. We then present two secure proxy re-signature schemes based on bilinear maps. Our first scheme relies on the Computational Diffie-Hellman (CDH) assumption; here the proxy can translate from Alice to Bob and vice-versa. Our second scheme relies on the CDH and 2-Discrete Logarithm (2-DL) assumptions and achieves a stronger security guarantee -- the proxy is only able to translate in one direction. Constructing such a scheme has been an open problem since proposed by BBS in 1998. Furthermore in this second scheme, even if the delegator and the proxy collude, they cannot sign on behalf of the delegatee. Both schemes are efficient and secure in the random oracle model.",

      "abstract": "We analyze the security of the iterated Even-Mansour cipher (a.k.a. key-alternating cipher), a very simple and natural construction of a blockcipher in the random permutation model. This construction, first considered by Even and Mansour (J. Cryptology, 1997) with a single permutation, was recently generalized to use t permutations in the work of Bogdanov et al. (EUROCRYPT 2012). They proved that the construction is secure up to $ \\mathcal{O} (N^{2/3})$ queries (where N is the domain size of the permutations), as soon as the number t of rounds is 2 or more. This is tight for t=2, however in the general case the best known attack requires Ω(Nt/(t+1)) queries. In this paper, we give asymptotically tight security proofs for two types of adversaries: \n \n1 for non-adaptive chosen-plaintext adversaries, we prove that the construction achieves an optimal security bound of $ \\mathcal{O} (N^{t/(t+1)})$ queries; \n \n2 for adaptive chosen-plaintext and ciphertext adversaries, we prove that the construction achieves security up to $ \\mathcal{O} (N^{t/(t+2)})$ queries (for t even). This improves previous results for t≥6. \n \nOur proof crucially relies on the use of a coupling to upper-bound the statistical distance of the outputs of the iterated Even-Mansour cipher to the uniform distribution.",

The main reason for this limitation is that at the core of many advanced lattice primitives is a trapdoor sampling algorithm (Gentry, Peikert, Vaikuntanathan, STOC 2008) that produced outputs that were too long for practical applications. In this work, we show that using a particular distribution over NTRU lattices can make GPV-based schemes suitable for practice. More concretely, we present the first lattice-based IBE scheme with practical parameters – key and ciphertext sizes are between two and four kilobytes, and all encryption and decryption operations take approximately one millisecond on a moderately-powered laptop. As a by-product, we also obtain digital signature schemes which are shorter than the previously most-compact ones of Ducas, Durmus, Lepoint, and Lyubashevsky from Crypto 2013.",

This problemarises in e-cash systems, anonymous credential systems, and variousother practical uses of zero-knowledge protocols. \n \nWhen using commitment schemes relying on RSA-like assumptions,there are solutions to this problem which require only a constantnumber of RSA-group elements to be exchanged between the prover andverifier [5, 15, 16]. However, for many commitment schemes based onbilinear group assumptions, these techniques do not work, and thebest known protocols require O (k ) group elementsto be exchanged where k is a security parameter. \n \nIn this paper, we present two new approaches to buildingset-membership proofs. The first is based on bilinear groupassumptions. When applied to the case where φ is arange of integers, our protocols require $O(\\frac{k}{\\log k -\\log\\log k})$ group elements to be exchanged. Not only is thisresult asymptotically better, but the constants are small enough toprovide significant improvements even for small ranges. Indeed, fora discrete logarithm based setting, our new protocol is an order ofmagnitude more efficient than previously known ones. \n \nWe also discuss alternative implementations of our membershipproof based on the strong RSA assumption.

We seek a \"natural\" and realizable notion of security, which is usable in higher-level protocols and applications. To this end, we formulate entropic leakage-resilient PKE. This notion captures the intuition that as long as the entropy of the encrypted message is higher than the amount of leakage, the message still has some (pseudo) entropy left. We show that this notion is realized by the Naor-Segev constructions (using hash proof systems). \n \nWe demonstrate that entropic leakage-resilience is useful by showing a simple construction that uses it to get semantic security in the presence of after-the-fact leakage, in a model of bounded memory leakage from a split state.",

Based on behavioral science findings, the experiment included four different training conditions, each of which used a different type of message framing. The results from three trials showed that framing had no significant effect on the likelihood that a participant would click a subsequent spear phishing email and that many participants either clicked all links or none regardless of whether they received training. The study was unable to determine whether the embedded training materials created framing changes on susceptibility to spear phishing attacks because employees failed to read the training materials.",

      "abstract": "We consider the problem of maximizing a (non-monotone) submodular function subject to a cardinality constraint. In addition to capturing well-known combinatorial optimization problems, e.g., Max-k-Coverage and Max-Bisection, this problem has applications in other more practical settings such as natural language processing, information retrieval, and machine learning. In this work we present improved approximations for two variants of the cardinality constraint for non-monotone functions. When at most k elements can be chosen, we improve the current best 1/e -- o(1) approximation to a factor that is in the range [1/e + 0.004, 1/2], achieving a tight approximation of 1/2 -- o(1) for k = n/2 and breaking the 1/e barrier for all values of k. When exactly k elements must be chosen, our algorithms improve the current best 1/4 -- o(1) approximation to a factor that is in the range [0.356, 1/2], again achieving a tight approximation of 1/2 -- o(1) for k = n/2. Additionally, some of the algorithms we provide are very fast with time complexities of O(nk), as opposed to previous known algorithms which are continuous in nature, and thus, too slow for applications in the practical settings mentioned above. \n \nOur algorithms are based on two new techniques. First, we present a simple randomized greedy approach where in each step a random element is chosen from a set of \"reasonably good\" elements. This approach might be considered a natural substitute for the greedy algorithm of Nemhauser, Wolsey and Fisher [45], as it retains the same tight guarantee of 1--1/e for monotone objectives and the same time complexity of O(nk), while giving an approximation of 1/e for general non-monotone objectives (while the greedy algorithm of Nemhauser et. al. fails to provide any constant guarantee). Second, we extend the double greedy technique, which achieves a tight 1/2 approximation for unconstrained submodular maximization, to the continuous setting. This allows us to manipulate the natural rates by which elements change, thus bounding the total number of elements chosen.",

In particular, for every language in P we obtain a delegation scheme with almost linear time verification. Our construction relies on the existence of a computational sub-exponentially secure private information retrieval (PIR) scheme.\n The proof exploits a curious connection between the problem of computation delegation and the model of multi-prover interactive proofs that are sound against no-signaling (cheating) strategies, a model that was studied in the context of multi-prover interactive proofs with provers that share quantum entanglement, and is motivated by the physical principle that information cannot travel faster than light.\n For any language computable in time t = t(n), we construct a multi-prover interactive proof (MIP) that is sound against no-signaling strategies, where the running time of the provers is poly(t), the number of provers is polylog(t), and the running time of the verifier is n · polylog(t).\n In particular, this shows that the class of languages that have polynomial-time MIPs that are sound against no-signaling strategies, is exactly EXP. Previously, this class was only known to contain PSPACE.\n To convert our MIP into a 1-round delegation scheme, we use the method suggested by Aiello et al (ICALP, 2000). This method relies on the existence of a sub-exponentially secure PIR scheme, and was proved secure by Kalai et al (STOC, 2013) assuming the underlying MIP is secure against no-signaling provers.",

      "abstract": "As cryptographic proofs have become essentially unverifiable, cryptographers have argued in favor of developing techniques that help tame the complexity of their proofs. Game-based techniques provide a popular approach in which proofs are structured as sequences of games and in which proof steps establish the validity of transitions between successive games. Code-based techniques form an instance of this approach that takes a code-centric view of games, and that relies on programming language theory to justify proof steps. While code-based techniques contribute to formalize the security statements precisely and to carry out proofs systematically, typical proofs are so long and involved that formal verification is necessary to achieve a high degree of confidence. We present Certicrypt, a framework that enables the machine-checked construction and verification of code-based proofs. Certicrypt is built upon the general-purpose proof assistant Coq, and draws on many areas, including probability, complexity, algebra, and semantics of programming languages. Certicrypt provides certified tools to reason about the equivalence of probabilistic programs, including a relational Hoare logic, a theory of observational equivalence, verified program transformations, and game-based techniques such as reasoning about failure events. The usefulness of Certicrypt is demonstrated through various examples, including a proof of semantic security of OAEP (with a bound that improves upon existing published results), and a proof of existential unforgeability of FDH signatures. Our work provides a first yet significant step towards Halevi's ambitious programme of providing tool support for cryptographic proofs.",

We assume a collection of n users, each employing a mixed strategy, which is a probability distribution over links, to control the routing of its own assigned traffic. In a Nash equilibrium, each user selfishly routes its traffic on those links that minimize its expected latency cost, given the network congestion caused by the other users. The social cost of a Nash equilibrium is the expectation, over all random choices of the users, of the maximum, over all links, latency through a link.We embark on a systematic study of several algorithmic problems related to the computation of Nash equilibria for the selfish routing game we consider. In a nutshell, these problems relate to deciding the existence of a Nash equilibrium, constructing a Nash equilibrium with given support characteristics, constructing the worst Nash equilibrium (the one with maximum social cost), constructing the best Nash equilibrium (the one with minimum social cost), or computing the social cost of a (given) Nash equilibrium. Our work provides a comprehensive collection of efficient algorithms, hardness results (both as NP-hardness and #P-completeness results), and structural results for these algorithmic problems. Our results span and contrast a wide range of assumptions on the syntax of the Nash equilibria and on the parameters of the system.",

In this paper we present attacks on 7-round, 8-round, and 10-round variants of Serpent. We attack a 7- round variant with all key lengths, and 8- and 10-round variants with 256-bit keys. The 10-round attack on the 256-bit keys variants is the best published attack on the cipher. The attack enhances the amplified boomerang attack and uses better differentials.

      "abstract": "A T-function is a mapping from n-bit words to n-bit words in which for each 0 ≤ i <n bit i of the output can depend only on bits 0,1,..., i of the input. All the boolean operations and most of the numeric operations in modern processors are T-functions, and their compositions are also T-functions. In earlier papers we considered ‘crazy’ T-functions such as f(x)= x+(x 2 ∨ 5), proved that they are invertible mappings which contain all the 2 n possible states on a single cycle for any word size n, and proposed to use them as primitive building blocks in a new class of software-oriented cryptographic schemes. The main practical drawback of this approach is that most processors have either 32 or 64 bit words, and thus even a maximal length cycle (of size 232 or 264) may be too short. In this paper we develop new ways to construct invertible T-functions on multiword states whose iteration is guaranteed to yield a single cycle of arbitrary length (say, 2256). Such mappings can lead to stream ciphers whose software implementation on a standard Pentium 4 processor can encrypt more than 5 gigabits of data per second, which is an order of magnitude faster than previous designs such as RC4.",

In this setting, a signature can only be verified by a unique and specific user. At Crypto’03, Desmedt suggested the problem of generalizing the designated verifier signatures. In this case, a signature should be intended to a specific set of different verifiers. In this article, we provide a formal definition of multi-designated verifiers signatures and give a rigorous treatment of the security model for such a scheme.

      "abstract": "Public-key cryptography based on the “ring-variant” of the Learning with Errors (ring-LWE) problem is both efficient and believed to remain secure in a post-quantum world. In this paper, we introduce a carefully-optimized implementation of a ring-LWE encryption scheme for 8-bit AVR processors like the ATxmega128. Our research contributions include several optimizations for the Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) used for polynomial multiplication. More concretely, we describe the Move-and-Add (MA) and the Shift-Add-Multiply-Subtract-Subtract (SAMS2) technique to speed up the performance-critical multiplication and modular reduction of coefficients, respectively. We take advantage of incompletely-reduced intermediate results to minimize the total number of reduction operations and use a special coefficient-storage method to decrease the RAM footprint of NTT multiplications. In addition, we propose a byte-wise scanning strategy to improve the performance of a discrete Gaussian sampler based on the Knuth-Yao random walk algorithm. For medium-term security, our ring-LWE implementation needs 590 k, 672 k, and 276 k clock cycles for key-generation, encryption, and decryption, respectively. On the other hand, for long-term security, the execution time of key-generation, encryption, and decryption amount to 2.2 M, 2.6 M, and 686 k cycles, respectively. These results set new speed records for ring-LWE encryption on an 8-bit processor and outperform related RSA and ECC implementations by an order of magnitude.",

In quantum public-key cryptosystems, all parties including senders, receivers and adversaries are modeled as quantum (probabilistic) poly-time Turing (QPT) machines and only classical channels (i.e., no quantum channels) are employed. A quantum trapdoor one-way function, f, plays an essential role in our system, in which a QPT machine can compute f with high probability, any QPT machine can invert f with negligible probability, and a QPT machine with trapdoor data can invert f. This paper proposes a concrete scheme for quantum public-key cryptosystems: a quantum public-key encryption scheme or quantum trapdoor one-way function. The security of our schemes is based on the computational assumption (over QPT machines) that a class of subset-sum problems is intractable against any QPT machine. Our scheme is very efficient and practical if Shor's discrete logarithm algorithm is efficiently realized on a quantum machine.",

Our second contribution is to show that the security of all schemes of this type depends on the difficulty of computing the endomorphism ring of a supersingular elliptic curve. This result gives significant insight into the difficulty of the isogeny problem that underlies the security of these schemes. Our third contribution is to give a reduction that uses partial knowledge of shared keys to determine an entire shared key. This can be used to retrieve the secret key, given information leaked from a side-channel attack on the key exchange protocol.

Moreover, there exists a satelite broadcasting random bits at a very low signal power. Alice and Bob can receive these bits with certain bit error probabilities ?A and ?B, respectively (e.g. ?A = ?B = 30%) while Eve is assumed to receive the same bits much more reliably with bit error probability ?E ? ?A, ?B (e.g. ?E = 1%). The errors on the three channels are assumed to occur at least partially independently. Practical protocols are discussed by which Alice and Bob can generate a secret key despite the facts that Eve possesses more information than both of them and is assumed to have unlimited computational resources as well as complete knowledge of the protocols.The described scenario is a special case of a much more general setup in which Alice, Bob and Eve are assumed to know random variables X, Y and Z jointly distributed according to some probability distribution PXYZ, respectively. The results of this paper suggest to build cryptographic systems that are provably secure against enemies with unlimited computing power under realistic assumptions about the partial independence of the noise on the involved communication channels.",

Roughly speaking, using random values unknown to an adversary one masks the input to a cryptographic algorithm. As a result, the intermediate results in the algorithm computation are uncorrelated to the input and the adversary cannot obtain any useful information from the side-channel. Unfortunately, previous AES randomization techniques have based their security on heuristics and experiments. Thus, flaws have been found which make AES randomized implementations still vulnerable to side-channel cryptanalysis. In this paper, we provide a formal notion of security for randomized maskings of arbitrary cryptographic algorithms. Furthermore, we present an AES randomization technique that is provably secure against side-channel attacks if the adversary is able to access a single intermediate result. Our randomized masking technique is quite general and it can be applied to arbitrary algorithms using only arithmetic operations over some finite field. To our knowledge this is the first time that a randomization technique for the AES has been proven secure in a formal model.",

The paradigm of counterexample-guided abstraction refinement suggests a fully automatic way of finding suitable abstract models: one starts with a coarse abstraction, attempts to verify or control the abstract model, and if this attempt fails and the abstract counterexample does not correspond to a concrete counterexample, then one uses the spurious counterexample to guide the refinement of the abstract model. We present a counterexample-guided refinement algorithm for solving ω-regular control objectives. The main difficulty is that in control, unlike in verification, counterexamples are strategies in a game between system and controller. In the case that the controller has no choices, our scheme subsumes known counterexample-guided refinement algorithms for the verification of ω-regular specifications. Our algorithm is useful in all situations where ω-regular games need to be solved, such as supervisory control, sequential and program synthesis, and modular verification. The algorithm is fully symbolic, and therefore applicable also to infinite-state systems.",

      "abstract": "Textbooks tell us that a birthday attack on a hash function h with range size r requires r 1/2 trials (hash computations) to find a collision. But this is quite misleading, being true only if h is regular, meaning all points in the range have the same number of pre-images under h; if h is not regular, fewer trials may be required. But how much fewer? This paper addresses this question by introducing a measure of the “amount of regularity” of a hash function that we call its balance, and then providing estimates of the success-rate of the birthday attack, and the expected number of trials to find a collision, as a function of the balance of the hash function being attacked. In particular, we will see that the number of trials can be significantly less than r 1/2 for hash functions of low balance. This leads us to examine popular design principles, such as the MD (Merkle-Damgard) transform, from the point of view of balance preservation, and to mount experiments to determine the balance of popular hash functions.",

So-called strong PUFs provide a mechanism to authenticate chips which is inherently unique for every manufactured sample. To prevent cloning, modeling of the challenge-response pair (CRP) behavior should be infeasible. Machine learning (ML) algorithms are a well-known threat. Recently, repeatability imperfections of PUF responses have been identified as another threat. CMOS device noise renders a significant fraction of the CRPs unstable, hereby providing a side channel for modeling attacks. In previous work, 65 nm arbiter PUFs have been modeled as such with accuracies exceeding 97%. However, more PUF evaluations were required than for state-of-the-art ML approaches. In this work, we accelerate repeatability attacks by increasing the fraction of unstable CRPs. Response evaluation faults are triggered via environmental changes hereby. The attack speed, which is proportional to the fraction of unstable CRPs, increases with a factor 2.4 for both arbiter and ring oscillator (RO) sum PUFs. Data originates from a 65 nm silicon chip and hence not from simulations.",

      "abstract": "The Maximal Independent Set (MIS) problem is one of the basics in the study of locality in distributed graph algorithms. This paper presents a very simple randomized algorithm for this problem providing a near-optimal local complexity, which incidentally, when combined with some known techniques, also leads to a near-optimal global complexity. Classical MIS algorithms of Luby [STOC'85] and Alon, Babai and Itai [JALG'86] provide the global complexity guarantee that, with high probability1, all nodes terminate after O(log n) rounds. In contrast, our initial focus is on the local complexity, and our main contribution is to provide a very simple algorithm guaranteeing that each particular node v terminates after O(log deg(v) + log 1/e) rounds, with probability at least 1 -- e. The degree-dependency in this bound is optimal, due to a lower bound of Kuhn, Moscibroda, and Wattenhofer [PODC'04]. Interestingly, this local complexity smoothly transitions to a global complexity: by adding techniques of Barenboim, Elkin, Pettie, and Schneider [FOCS'12; arXiv: 1202.1983v3], we2 get an MIS algorithm with a high probability global complexity of O(log Δ) + 2O([EQUATION]), where Δ denotes the maximum degree. This improves over the O(log2 Δ) + 2O([EQUATION]) result of Barenboim et al., and gets close to the Ω(min{log Δ, [EQUATION]}) lower bound of Kuhn et al. Corollaries include improved algorithms for MIS in graphs of upper-bounded arboricity, or lower-bounded girth, for Ruling Sets, for MIS in the Local Computation Algorithms (LCA) model, and a faster distributed algorithm for the Lovasz Local Lemma.",

      "abstract": "Hardware technologies for trusted computing, or trusted execution environments (TEEs), have rapidly matured over the last decade. In fact, TEEs are at the brink of widespread commoditization with the recent introduction of Intel Software Guard Extensions (Intel SGX). Despite such rapid development of TEE, software technologies for TEE significantly lag behind their hardware counterpart, and currently only a select group of researchers have the privilege of accessing this technology. To address this problem, we develop an open source platform, called OpenSGX, that emulates Intel SGX hardware components at the instruction level and provides new system software components necessarily required for full TEE exploration. We expect that the OpenSGX framework can serve as an open platform for SGX research, with the following contributions. First, we develop a fully functional, instruction-compatible emulator of Intel SGX for enabling the exploration of software/hardware design space, and development of enclave programs. OpenSGX provides a platform for SGX development, meaning that it provides not just emulation but also operating system components, an enclave program loader/packager, an OpenSGX user library, debugging, and performance monitoring. Second, to show OpenSGX’s use cases, we applied OpenSGX to protect sensitive information (e.g., directory) of Tor nodes and evaluated their potential performance impacts. Therefore, we believe OpenSGX has great potential for broader communities to spark new research on soon-to-becommodity Intel SGX.",

      "abstract": "This article introduces a method of hiding transaction amounts in the strongly decentralized anonymous cryptocurrency Monero. Similar to Bitcoin, Monero is a cryptocurrency which is distributed through a proof-of-work “mining” process having no central party or trusted setup. The original Monero protocol was based on CryptoNote, which uses ring signatures and one-time keys to hide the destination and origin of transactions. Recently the technique of using a commitment scheme to hide the amount of a transaction has been discussed and implemented by Bitcoin Core developer Gregory Maxwell. In this article, a new type of ring signature, A Multilayered Linkable Spontaneous Anonymous Group signature is described which allows one to include a Pedersen Commitment in a ring signature. This construction results in a digital currency with hidden amounts, origins and destinations of transactions with reasonable efficiency and verifiable, trustless coin generation. The author would like to note that early drafts of this were publicized in the Monero Community and on the #bitcoin-wizards IRC channel. Blockchain hashed drafts are available showing that this work was started in Summer 2015, and completed in early October 2015. An eprint is also available at http://eprint.iacr.org/2015/1098 .",

The objective of IP Traceback is to determine the real attack sources, as well as the full path taken by the attack packets. Different traceback methods have been proposed, such as IP logging, IP marking and IETF ICMP Traceback (ITrace). In this paper, we propose an enhancement to the ICMP Traceback approach, called ICMP Traceback with Cumulative Path (ITrace-CP). The enhancement consists in encoding the entire attack path information in the ICMP Traceback message. Analytical and simulation studies have been performed to evaluate the performance improvements. We demonstrated that our enhanced solution provides faster construction of the attack graph, with only marginal increase in computation, storage and bandwidth.",

In single-parameter settings (i.e., where each agent's preference is given by a single private value for being served and zero for not being served) this problem is solved. Unfortunately, these single parameter optimal mechanisms are impractical and rarely employed, and furthermore the underlying economic theory fails to generalize to the important, relevant, and unsolved multi-dimensional setting (i.e., where each agent's preference is given by multiple values for each of the multiple services available). In contrast to the theory of optimal mechanisms we develop a theory of sequential posted price mechanisms, where agents in sequence are offered take-it-or-leave-it prices. We prove that these mechanisms are approximately optimal in single-dimensional settings. These posted-price mechanisms avoid many of the properties of optimal mechanisms that make the latter impractical. Furthermore, these mechanisms generalize naturally to multidimensional settings where they give the first known approximations to the elusive optimal multi-dimensional mechanism design problem.",

Low communication: independent of the function being computed (proportional to just input and output sizes).

      "abstract": "This paper fills an important foundational gap with the first proofs, under standard assumptions and in the standard model, of the existence of PRFs and PRPs resisting rich and relevant forms of related-key attack (RKA). An RKA allows the adversary to query the function not only under the target key but under other keys derived from it in adversary-specified ways. Based on the Naor-Reingold PRF we obtain an RKA-PRF whose keyspace is a group and that is proven, under DDH, to resist attacks in which the key may be operated on by arbitrary adversary-specified group elements. Our framework yields other RKA-PRFs including a DLIN-based one derived from the Lewko-Waters PRF. We show how to turn these PRFs into PRPs (blockciphers) while retaining security against RKAs. Over the last 17 years cryptanalysts and blockcipher designers have routinely and consistenly targeted RKA-security; it is important for abuse-resistant cryptography; and it helps protect against fault-injection sidechannel attacks. Yet ours are the first significant proofs of existence of secure constructs. We warn that our constructs are proofs-of-concept in the foundational style and not practical.",

One distinguishing feature of our model is that the systems of ITMs that we consider involve a generic mechanism for addressing dynamically generated copies of ITMs. We study properties of such systems and, in particular, show that systems satisfying a certain acyclicity condition run in polynomial time. Based on our general computational model, we state different notions of simulation-based security in a uniform and concise way, study their relationships, and prove a general composition theorem for composing a polynomial number of copies of protocols, where the polynomial is determined by the environment.

More flexible, decentralized cryptographic authorization credentials have not been adopted, largely because their mechanisms have not been incrementally deployable, simple enough, or efficient enough to implement across the relevant systems and devices. This paper introduces macaroons: flexible authorization credentials for Cloud services that support decentralized delegation between principals. Macaroons are based on a construction that uses nested, chained MACs (e.g., HMACs [43]) in a manner that is highly efficient, easy to deploy, and widely applicable. Although macaroons are bearer credentials, like Web cookies, macaroons embed caveats that attenuate and contextually confine when, where, by who, and for what purpose a target service should authorize requests. This paper describes macaroons and motivates their design, compares them to other credential systems, such as cookies and SPKI/SDSI [14], evaluates and measures a prototype implementation, and discusses practical security and application considerations. In particular, it is considered how macaroons can enable more fine-grained authorization in the Cloud, e.g., by strengthening mechanisms like OAuth2 [17], and a formalization of macaroons is given in authorization logic.",

      "abstract": "A new binary software randomization and ControlFlow Integrity (CFI) enforcement system is presented, which is the first to efficiently resist code-reuse attacks launched by informed adversaries who possess full knowledge of the inmemory code layout of victim programs. The defense mitigates a recent wave of implementation disclosure attacks, by which adversaries can exfiltrate in-memory code details in order to prepare code-reuse attacks (e.g., Return-Oriented Programming (ROP) attacks) that bypass fine-grained randomization defenses. Such implementation-aware attacks defeat traditional fine-grained randomization by undermining its assumption that the randomized locations of abusable code gadgets remain secret. Opaque CFI (O-CFI) overcomes this weakness through a novel combination of fine-grained code-randomization and coarsegrained control-flow integrity checking. It conceals the graph of hijackable control-flow edges even from attackers who can view the complete stack, heap, and binary code of the victim process. For maximal efficiency, the integrity checks are implemented using instructions that will soon be hardware-accelerated on commodity x86-x64 processors. The approach is highly practical since it does not require a modified compiler and can protect legacy binaries without access to source code. Experiments using our fully functional prototype implementation show that O-CFI provides significant probabilistic protection against ROP attacks launched by adversaries with complete code layout knowledge, and exhibits only 4.7% mean performance overhead on current hardware (with further overhead reductions to follow on forthcoming Intel processors). I. MOTIVATION Code-reuse attacks (cf., [5]) have become a mainstay of software exploitation over the past several years, due to the rise of data execution protections that nullify traditional codeinjection attacks. Rather than injecting malicious payload code directly onto the stack or heap, where modern data execution protections block it from being executed, attackers now ingeniously inject addresses of existing in-memory code fragments (gadgets) onto victim stacks, causing the victim process to execute its own binary code in an unanticipated order [38]. With a sufficiently large victim code section, the pool of exploitable gadgets becomes arbitrarily expressive (e.g., Turing-complete) [20], facilitating the construction of arbitrary attack payloads without the need for code-injection. Such payload construction has even been automated [34]. As a result, code-reuse has largely replaced code-injection as one of the top software security threats.

Prior defenses can generally be categorized into: CFI [1] and artificial software diversity [8]. CFI restricts all of a program’s runtime control-flows to a graph of whitelisted control-flow edges. Usually the graph is derived from the semantics of the program source code or a conservative disassembly of its binary code. As a result, CFIprotected programs reject control-flow hijacks that attempt to traverse edges not supported by the original program’s semantics. Fine-grained CFI monitors indirect control-flows precisely; for example, function callees must return to their exact callers. Although such precision provides the highest security, it also tends to incur high performance overheads (e.g., 21% for precise caller-callee return-matching [1]). Because this overhead is often too high for industry adoption, researchers have proposed many optimized, coarser-grained variants of CFI. Coarse-grained CFI trades some security for better performance by reducing the precision of the checks. For example, functions must return to valid call sites (but not necessarily to the particular site that invoked the callee). Unfortunately, such relaxations have proved dangerous—a number of recent proof-of-concept exploits have shown how even minor relaxations of the control-flow policy can be exploited to effect attacks [6, 11, 18, 19]. Table I summarizes the impact of several of these recent exploits. Artificial software diversity offers a different but complementary approach that randomizes programs in such a way that attacks succeeding against one program instance have a very low probability of success against other (independently randomized) instances of the same program. Probabilistic defenses rely on memory secrecy—i.e., the effects of randomization must remain hidden from attackers. One of the simplest and most widely adopted forms of artificial diversity is Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR), which randomizes the base addresses of program segments at loadtime. Unfortunately, merely randomizing the base addresses does not yield sufficient entropy to preserve memory secrecy in many cases; there are numerous successful derandomization attacks against ASLR [13, 26, 36, 37, 39, 42]. Finer-grained diversity techniques obtain exponentially higher entropy by randomizing the relative distances between all code points. For example, binary-level Self-Transforming Instruction Relocation (STIR) [45] and compilers with randomized code-generation (e.g., [22]) have both realized fine-grained artificial diversity for production-level software at very low overheads. Recently, a new wave of implementation disclosure attacks [4, 10, 35, 40] have threatened to undermine fine-grained artificial diversity defenses. Implementation disclosure attacks exploit information leak vulnerabilities to read memory pages of victim processes at the discretion of the attacker. By reading the TABLE I. OVERVIEW OF CONTROL-FLOW INTEGRITY BYPASSES CFI [1] bin-CFI [50] CCFIR [49] kBouncer [33] ROPecker [7] ROPGuard [16] EMET [30] DeMott [12] Feb 2014 / Göktaş et al. [18] May 2014 / / / Davi et al.

[19] Aug 2014 / / Carlini and Wagner [6] Aug 2014 / / in-memory code sections, attackers violate the memory secrecy assumptions of artificial diversity, rendering their defenses ineffective. Since finding and closing all information leaks is well known to be prohibitively difficult and often intractable for many large software products, these attacks constitute a very dangerous development in the cyber-threat landscape; there is currently no well-established, practical defense. This paper presents Opaque CFI (O-CFI): a new approach to coarse-grained CFI that strengthens fine-grained artificial diversity to withstand implementation disclosure attacks. The heart of O-CFI is a new form of control-flow check that conceals the graph of abusable control-flow edges even from attackers who have complete read-access to the randomized binary code, the stack, and the heap of victim processes. Such access only affords attackers knowledge of the intended (and therefore nonabusable) edges of the control-flow graph, not the edges left unprotected by the coarse-grained CFI implementation. Artificial diversification is employed to vary the set of unprotected edges between program instances, maintaining the probabilistic guarantees of fine-grained diversity. Experiments show that O-CFI enjoys performance overheads comparable to standard fine-grained diversity and non-opaque, coarse-grained CFI. Moreover, O-CFI’s control-flow checking logic is implemented using Intel x86/x64 memory-protection extensions (MPX) that are expected to be hardware-accelerated in commodity CPUs from 2015 onwards. We therefore expect even better performance for O-CFI in the near future. Our contributions are as follows: • We introduce O-CFI, the first low-overhead code-reuse defense that tolerates implementation disclosures. • We describe our implementation of a fully functional prototype that protects stripped, x86 legacy binaries without source code. • Analysis shows that O-CFI provides quantifiable security against state-of-the-art exploits—including JITROP [40] and Blind-ROP [4]. • Performance evaluation yields competitive overheads of just 4.7% for computation-intensive programs. II. THREAT MODEL Our work is motivated by the emergence of attacks against fine-grained diversity and coarse-grained control-flow integrity. We therefore introduce these attacks and distill them into a single, unified threat model. A. Bypassing Coarse-Grained CFI Ideally, CFI permits only programmer-intended control-flow transfers during a program’s execution. The typical approach is to assign a unique ID to each permissible indirect controlflow target, and check the IDs at runtime. Unfortunately, this introduces performance overhead proportional to the degree of the graph—the more overlaps between valid target sets of indirect branch instructions, the more IDs must be stored and checked at each branch. Moreover, perfect CFI cannot be realized with a purely static control-flow graph; for example, the permissible destinations of function returns depend on the calling context, which is only known at runtime. Fine-grained CFI therefore implements a dynamically computed shadow stack, incurring high overheads [1]. To avoid this, coarse-grained CFI implementations resort to a reduced-degree, static approximation of the control-flow graph, and merge identifiers at the cost of reduced security. For example, bin-CFI [49] and CCFIR [50] use at most three IDs per branch, and omit shadow stacks. Recent work has demonstrated that these optimizations open exploitable",

The well-known problem of computing discrete logarithms in finite fields has acquired additional importance in recent years due to its applicability in cryptography. Several cryptographic systems would become insecure if an efficient discrete logarithm algorithm were discovered. This paper surveys and analyzes known algorithms in this area, with special attention devoted to algorithms for the fields GF(2n). It appears that in order to be safe from attacks using these algorithms, the value of n for which GF(2n) is used in a cryptosystem has to be very large and carefully chosen. Due in large part to recent discoveries, discrete logarithms in fields GF(2n) are much easier to compute than in fields GF(p) with p prime. Hence the fields GF(2n) ought to be avoided in all cryptographic applications. On the other hand, the fields GF(p) with p prime appear to offer relatively high levels of security.",

Goubin proposed a variant of DPA using the point (0,y), which is not randomized in Jacobian coordinates or in the isomorphic class. This point often exists in the standard curves, and we have to care this attack. In this paper, we propose the zero-value point attack as an extension of Goubin’s attack. Note that even if a point has no zero-value coordinate, the auxiliary registers might take zero-value. We investigate these zero-value registers that cannot be randomized by the above randomization. Indeed, we have found several points P = (x,y) which cause the zero-value registers, e.g., (1)3x 2 + a = 0, (2)5x 4 + 2ax 2 – 4bx + a 2 = 0, (3)P is y-coordinate self-collision point, etc. We demonstrate the standard curves that have these points. Interestingly, some conditions required for the zero-value attack depend on the explicit implementation of the addition formula — in order to resist this type of attacks, we have to care how to implement the addition formula. Finally, we note that Goubin’s attack and the proposed attack assume that the base point P can be chosen by the attacker and the secret scalar d is fixed, so that they are not applicable to ECDSA signature generation.",

      "abstract": "Our methodology for the abstract specification of (classes of) objects parallels traditional algebraic ADT specifications in many ways. We believe that our approach clarifies the essential difference between data abstraction and object abstraction. It stresses the connection of the behavior of objects with sequences of messages while maintaining the essence of state as an overt but completely abstract entity. While we abstract away from details about state, we do not regard it as a hidden sort as in [GM87] — the presence or absence of state is not transparent. Effective integration of the state concept into formal specification enhances an intuitively natural match of the abstraction with implementation details. The idea of viewing state as a hidden argument captures intuition better since its connection with the visible operations is concealed but not completely severed. The approach we suggest begins with categorizing the methods according to their dependence and effect on the internal state of an object and making those categories an explicit part of the specification. Specifications of the state transition functions are associated with the side-effect inducing methods and provide an abstract description of each of them and the states. Once the state behavior is established, descriptions of the state-dependent methods can be pursued. Because of the role of states in overall behavior, our specifications are intended to distinguish objects only if they have observable behavior which differs. Thus we prefer the final algebra interpretation [GH78, Kam83, Wan79] over the initial algebra view [GTW78]. Of course, the state-independent methods constitute an ordinary ADT and can be specified by well established means. We wish to describe object behavior and hence seek to avoid differentiation of objects based on their internal structure. Hence two states are equivalent (indistinguishable) provided that if we start with two objects, one in each of these states, then for every sequence of messages ending with a selector message, both objects return the same result — that is, the two objects are indistinguishable by any external means. In the ADT literature this is known as the \" final algebra \" view. Since our approach results in an ADT-style description of a collection of functions, ADT analysis concepts generally apply. For instance, \" sufficient completeness \" for terms whose primary operation is a selector remains a property of interest. The primary difference to be accounted for is with the State domain which is represented by sequences of side-effect …",

Our protocols are robust in the sense that the correct signature is computed even if up to T - 1 players behave in arbitrarily malicious way during the signature protocol. This in particular includes the cases of players that refuse to participate or that generate incorrect partial signatures. Our robust protocols achieve optimal resiliency as they can tolerate up to (N - 1)/2 faults, and their efficiency is comparable to the efficiency of the underlying threshold RSA signature scheme. \n \nRobust threshold signature schemes have very important applications, since they provide increased security and availability for a signing server (e.g. a certification authority or an electronic cash provider). Solutions for the case of the RSA signature scheme are especially important because of its widespread use. In addition, these techniques apply to shared RSA decryption as well, thus leading to efficient key escrow schemes for RSA. \n \nOur schemes are based on some interesting extensions that we devised for the information checking protocol of T.

One of the significant benefit of their construction is scalability, where the overhead of the trusted authority is logarithmically increased in the number of users, whereas that in the Boneh-Franklin naive revocation way is linearly increased. All subsequent RIBE schemes follow the Boldyreva et al. security model and syntax. In this paper, we first revisit the Boldyreva et al. security model, and aim at capturing the exact notion for the security of the naive but non-scalable Boneh-Franklin RIBE scheme. To this end, we consider a realistic threat, which we call decryption key exposure. We also show that all prior RIBE constructions except for the Boneh-Franklin one are vulnerable to decryption key exposure. As the second contribution, we revisit approaches to achieve (efficient and adaptively secure) scalable RIBE schemes, and propose a simple RIBE scheme, which is the first scalable RIBE scheme with decryption key exposure resistance, and is more efficient than previous (adaptively secure) scalable RIBE schemes. In particular, our construction has the shortest ciphertext size and the fastest decryption algorithm even compared with all scalable RIBE schemes without decryption key exposure resistance.",

The computation should be carried out in a secure way, meaning that no coalition of corrupted parties should be able to learn more than specified or somehow cause the result to be \"incorrect\". Typically, corrupted parties are either assumed to be semi-honest (meaning that they follow the protocol specification) or malicious (meaning that they may deviate arbitrarily from the protocol). However, in many settings, the assumption regarding semi-honest behavior does not suffice and security in the presence of malicious adversaries is excessive and expensive to achieve. \n \nIn this paper, we introduce the notion of covert adversaries, which we believe faithfully models the adversarial behavior in many commercial, political, and social settings. Covert adversaries have the property that they may deviate arbitrarily from the protocol specification in an attempt to cheat, but do not wish to be \"caught\" doing so. We provide a definition of security for covert adversaries and show that it is possible to obtain highly efficient protocols that are secure against such adversaries. We stress that in our definition, we quantify over all (possibly malicious) adversaries and do not assume that the adversary behaves in any particular way. Rather, we guarantee that if an adversary deviates from the protocol in a way that would enable it to \"cheat\", then the honest parties are guaranteed to detect this cheating with good probability. We argue that this level of security is sufficient in many settings.",

Firstly, we present a novel experimental approach to construct the best known integral distinguishers of SIMON32. The small block size, 32 bits, of SIMON32 enables us to experimentally find a 15-round integral distinguisher, based on which we present a key recovery attack on 21-round SIMON32, while previous best results only achieved 19 rounds. Moreover, we attack 20-round SIMON32, 20-round SIMON48/72 and 21-round SIMON48/96 based on 11 and 12-round zero-correlation linear hulls of SIMON32 and SIMON48 respectively. Finally, we propose new impossible differential attacks which improve the previous impossible differential attacks. Our analysis shows that SIMON maintains enough security margin.",

Our axiomatic semantics is an extension of the call-by-value $\\lambda$-calculus with staging constructs. We demonstrate the soundness of the axiomatic semantics with respect to the natural semantics. We show that staged-languages can ``go Wrong'''' in new ways, and devise a type system that screens out such programs. Finally, we present a proof of the soundness of this type system with respect to the reduction semantics, and show how to extend this result to the natural semantics.",

      "abstract": "Identity-Based Encryption (IBE) offers an interesting alternative to PKI-enabled encryption as it eliminates the need for digital certificates. While revocation has been thoroughly studied in PKIs, few revocation mechanisms are known in the IBE setting. Until quite recently, the most convenient one was to augment identities with period numbers at encryption. All non-revoked receivers were thus forced to obtain a new decryption key at discrete time intervals, which places a significant burden on the authority. A more efficient method was suggested by Boldyreva, Goyal and Kumar at CCS'08. In their revocable IBE scheme, key updates have logarithmic (instead of linear in the original method) complexity for the trusted authority. Unfortunately, security could only be proved in the selective-ID setting where adversaries have to declare which identity will be their prey at the very beginning of the attack game. In this work, we describe an adaptive-ID secure revocable IBE scheme and thus solve a problem left open by Boldyreva et al. .",

These techniques yield zero-sum partitions of size 21575 for the full Keccak-f permutation and several observations on the Luffa hash family. We first show that Luffa v1 applied to one-block messages is a function of 255 variables with degree at most 251. This observation leads to the construction of a higher-order differential distinguisher for the full Luffa v1 hash function, similar to the one presented by Watanabe et al. on a reduced version.

We give evidence that when using an algebraic structure, the ability to trace with the IPP algorithm implies the ability to trace with the TA algorithm.

This paper shows how to perform various privacypreserving operations in a scalable manner under the honest-but-curious model. Our system provides the same level of scalability as a trusted central party based solution while providing privacy guarantees without the need for heavyweight cryptography. The key idea is to develop an alternative system model using a Two-Party Query Computation Model comprising of a randomizer and a computing engine which do not reveal any information between themselves. We also show how one can replace the randomizer by a lightweight key-agreement protocol. We formally prove the privacy-preserving properties of our protocols and demonstrate the scalability and practicality of our system using a real-world implementation.",

However, they left as an open problem that of designing an encryption scheme that simultaneously provides security against both key dependent chosen plaintext and adaptive chosen ciphertext attack (KDM-CCA2 security). In this paper, we solve this problem. First, we show that by applying the Naor-Yung \"double encryption\" paradigm, one can combine any KDM-CPA secure scheme with any (ordinary) CCA2 secure scheme, along with an appropriate non-interactive zero-knowledge proof, to obtain a KDM-CCA2 secure scheme. Second, we give a concrete instantiation that makes use the above KDM-CPA secure scheme of BHHO, along with a generalization of the Cramer-Shoup CCA2 secure encryption scheme, and recently developed pairing-based NIZK proof systems.

In this setting, we are concerned with designing protocols that minimize the computation of the parties at the expense of the server. We develop new definitions of security for this server-aided setting that generalize the standard simulation-based definitions for MPC and allow us to formally capture the existence of dishonest but non-colluding participants. This requires us to introduce a formal characterization of non-colluding adversaries that may be of independent interest. We then design general and special-purpose server-aided MPC protocols that are more efficient (in terms of computation and communication) for the parties than the alternative of running a standard MPC protocol (i.e., without the server). Our main general-purpose protocol provides security when there is at least one honest party with input. We also construct a new and efficient server-aided protocol for private set intersection and give a general transformation from any secure delegated computation scheme to a server-aided two-party protocol. ∗Microsoft Research. senyk@microsoft.com. †University of Calgary. pmohassel@cspc.ucalgary.ca.

      "abstract": "We construct a general multiparty computation MPC protocol with only two rounds of interaction in the common random string model, which is known to be optimal. In the honest-but-curious setting we only rely on the learning with errors LWE assumption, and in the fully malicious setting we additionally assume the existence of non-interactive zero knowledge arguments NIZKs. Previously, Asharov et al. EUROCRYPT '12 showed how to achieve three rounds based on LWE and NIZKs, while Garg et al. TCC '14 showed how to achieve the optimal two rounds based on indistinguishability obfuscation, but it was unknown if two rounds were possible under standard assumptions without obfuscation. \n \nOur approach relies on multi-key fully homomorphic encryption MFHE, introduced by Lopez-Alt et al. STOC '12, which enables homomorphic computation over data encrypted under different keys. We present a construction of MFHE based on LWE that significantly simplifies a recent scheme of Clear and McGoldrick CRYPTO '15. We then extend this construction to allow for a one-round distributed decryption of a multi-key ciphertext. Our entire MPC protocol consists of the following two rounds:1.Each party individually encrypts its input under its own key and broadcasts the ciphertext. All parties can then homomorphically compute a multi-key encryption of the output.2.Each party broadcasts a partial decryption of the output using its secret key. The partial decryptions can be combined to recover the output in plaintext.",

The protocol has very minimal computation and communication; for Boolean circuits, each party sends only a single bit for every AND gate (and nothing is sent for XOR gates). Our protocol is (simulation-based) secure in the presence of semi-honest adversaries, and achieves privacy in the client/server model in the presence of malicious adversaries. On a cluster of three 20-core servers with a 10Gbps connection, the implementation of our protocol carries out over 1.3 million AES computations per second, which involves processing over 7 billion gates per second. In addition, we developed a Kerberos extension that replaces the ticket-granting-ticket encryption on the Key Distribution Center (KDC) in MIT-Kerberos with our protocol, using keys/ passwords that are shared between the servers. This enables the use of Kerberos while protecting passwords. Our implementation is able to support a login storm of over 35,000 logins per second, which suffices even for very large organizations. Our work demonstrates that high-throughput secure computation is possible on standard hardware.",

In 2012, Lopez-Alt, Tromer and Vaikuntanathan proposed a fully homomorphic scheme based on this modified system. However, to allow homomorphic operations and prove security, a non-standard assumption is required. In this paper, we show how to remove this non-standard assumption via techniques introduced by Brakerski and construct a new fully homomorphic encryption scheme from the Stehle and Steinfeld version based on standard lattice assumptions and a circular security assumption. The scheme is scale-invariant and therefore avoids modulus switching and the size of ciphertexts is one ring element. Moreover, we present a practical variant of our scheme, which is secure under stronger assumptions, along with parameter recommendations and promising implementation results. Finally, we present an approach for encrypting larger input sizes by extending ciphertexts to several ring elements via the CRT on the message space.",

In this paper we reduce the public key size to O(λ7) by encrypting with a quadratic form in the public key elements, instead of a linear form. We prove that the scheme remains semantically secure, based on a stronger variant of the approximate-GCD problem, already considered by van Dijk et al. \n \nWe alsodescribe the first implementation of the resulting fully homomorphic scheme. Borrowing some optimizations from the recent Gentry-Halevi implementation of Gentry's scheme, we obtain roughly the same level of efficiency.

We extend it to the first short LRS scheme, and reduce its security to a new hardness assumption, the Link Decisional RSA (LD-RSA) Assumption. We also extend [18]'s other schemes to a generic LRS scheme and a generic linkable group signature scheme. We discuss three applications of our schemes. Kiayias and Yung [22] constructed the first e-voting scheme which simultaneously achieves efficient tallying, public verifiability, and write-in capability for a typical voter distribution under which only a small portion writes in. We construct an e-voting scheme based on our short LRS scheme which achieves the same even for all worst-case voter distribution. Direct Anonymous Attestation (DAA) [6] is essentially a ring signature scheme with certain linking properties that can be naturally implemented using LRS schemes. The construction of an offline anonymous e-cash scheme using LRS schemes is also discussed.",

This is the first impossibility result that exploits unbounded collusions in an essential way. In particular, we show that there are no such functional encryption schemes for the class of weak pseudo-random functions (and more generally, for any class of incompressible functions). More quantitatively, our technique also gives us a lower bound for functional encryption schemes secure against bounded collusions. To be secure against q collusions, we show that the ciphertext in any such scheme must have size Ω(q). \n \nWe put forth and discuss a simulation-based notion of security for functional encryption, with an unbounded simulator (called USIM).

However, for nonlocal problems, like the fundamental class of connectivity problems, for a long time we did not know how to do this faster than tw O ( tw ) | V | O ( 1 ) . Recently, Cygan et al.?(FOCS 2011) presented Monte Carlo algorithms for a wide range of connectivity problems running in time c tw | V | O ( 1 ) for a small constant c, e.g., for Hamiltonian Cycle?and Steiner Tree. Naturally, this raises the question whether randomization is necessary to achieve this runtime; furthermore, it is desirable to also solve counting and weighted versions (the latter without incurring a pseudo-polynomial cost in the runtime in terms of the weights).We present two new approaches rooted in linear algebra, based on matrix rank and determinants, which provide deterministic c tw | V | O ( 1 ) time algorithms, also for weighted and counting versions. For example, in this time we can solve Traveling Salesman? or count the number of Hamiltonian cycles. The rank based ideas provide a rather general approach for speeding up even straightforward dynamic programming formulations by identifying \"small\" sets of representative partial solutions; we focus on the case of expressing connectivity via sets of partitions, but the essential ideas should have further applications. The determinant-based approach uses the Matrix Tree Theorem for deriving closed formulas for counting versions of connectivity problems; we show how to evaluate those formulas via dynamic programming.",

Recent papers have focused their attention on constructing schemes for general functionalities at expense of efficiency. Our goal, in this paper, is to construct functional encryption schemes for less general functionalities which are still expressive enough for practical scenarios. We propose a functional encryption scheme for the inner-product functionality, meaning that decrypting an encrypted vector \\(\\mathbf {x}\\) with a key for a vector \\(\\mathbf {y}\\) will reveal only \\(\\langle \\mathbf {x},\\mathbf {y} \\rangle \\) and nothing else, whose security is based on the DDH assumption. Despite the simplicity of this functionality, it is still useful in many contexts like descriptive statistics. In addition, we generalize our approach and present a generic scheme that can be instantiated, in addition, under the LWE assumption and offers various trade-offs in terms of expressiveness and efficiency.",

      "abstract": "We point to three types of potential vulnerabilities in the Bluetooth standard, version 1.0B. The first vulnerability opens up the system to an attack in which an adversary under certain circumstances is able to determine the key exchanged by two victim devices, making eavesdropping and impersonation possible. This can be done either by exhaustively searching all possible PINs (but without interacting with the victim devices), or by mounting a so-called middle-person attack. We show that one part of the key exchange protocol - an exponential back-off method employed in case of incorrect PIN usage - adds no security, but in fact benefits an attacker. The second vulnerability makes possible an attack - which we call a location attack - in which an attacker is able to identify and determine the geographic location of victim devices. This, in turn, can be used for industrial espionage, blackmail, and other undesirable activities. The third vulnerability concerns the cipher. We show two attacks on the cipher, and one attack on the use of the cipher. The former two do not pose any practical threat, but the latter is serious. We conclude by exhibiting a range of methods that can be employed to strengthen the protocol and prevent the newly discovered attacks. Our suggested alterations are simple, and are expected to be possible to be implemented without major modifications.",

Over the last decade, many works have described and improved DFA techniques against block ciphers thus showing an inherent need to protect their implementations. A simple and widely used solution is to perform the computation twice and to check that the same result is obtained. Since DFA against block ciphers usually targets the last few rounds, one does not need to protect the whole ciphering thus saving computation time. However the number of rounds to protect must be chosen very carefully in order to prevent security flaws. To determine this number, one must study DFA targeting middle rounds of the cipher. In this paper, we address this issue for the Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm. We describe an attack that breaks DES by introducing some faults at the end of round 9, 10, 11 or 12, more or less efficiently depending on the fault model and the round number.",

Using RIPEMD-160 as an example, our attack can find a second preimage for a 260 byte message in about 2106 work, rather than the previously expected 2160 work. We also provide slightly cheaper ways to find multicollisions than the method of Joux [Jou04]. Both of these results are based on expandable messages–patterns for producing messages of varying length, which all collide on the intermediate hash result immediately after processing the message. We provide an algorithm for finding expandable messages for any n-bit hash function built using the Damgard-Merkle construction, which requires only a small multiple of the work done to find a single collision in the hash function.",

      "abstract": "Suppose that a receiver R wishes to publish an encryption of her secret input x so that every sender S, holding an input y, can reveal f(x, y) to R by sending her a single message. This should be done while simultaneously protecting the secrecy of y against a corrupted R and preventing a corrupted S from having an unfair influence on the output of R beyond what is allowed by f. \n \nWhen the parties are semi-honest, practical solutions can be based on Yao's garbled circuit technique. However, for the general problem when the parties, or even S alone, may be malicious, all known polynomial-time solutions are highly inefficient. This is due in part to the fact that known solutions make a non-black-box use of cryptographic primitives, e.g., for providing non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs of statements involving cryptographic computations on secrets. \n \nMotivated by the above question, we consider the problem of secure two-party computation in a model that allows only parallel calls to an ideal oblivious transfer (OT) oracle with no additional interaction. We obtain the following results. - Feasibility. We present the first general protocols in this model which only make a black-box use of a pseudorandom generator (PRG). All previous OT-based protocols either make a non-black-box use of cryptographic primitives or require multiple rounds of interaction. - Efficiency. We also consider the question of minimizing the asymptotic number of PRG calls made by such protocols. We show that polylog(κ) calls are sufficient for each gate in a (large) boolean circuit computing f, where κ is a statistical security parameter guaranteeing at most 2-κ simulation error of a malicious sender. Furthermore, the number of PRG calls per gate can be made constant by settling for a relaxed notion of security which allows a malicious S to arbitrarily correlate the event that R detects cheating with the input of R. This improves over the state of the art also for interactive constant-round black-box protocols, which required Ω(κ) PRG calls per gate, even with similar relaxations of the notion of security. \n \nCombining the above results with 2-message (parallel) OT protocols in the CRS model, we get the first solutions to the initial motivating question which only make a black-box use of standard cryptographic primitives.",

Our method does not involve other cryptographic primitives—in particular, it does not use signatures—which simplifies the protocol and enables us to base the security directly on the hardness of the ring learning with errors problem.

So far, security and efficiency of cloud storage have been separately investigated as follows: On one hand, security notions such as Proof of Data Possession (PDP) and Proof of Retrievability (POR) have been introduced for detecting that the data stored in the cloud has been tampered with. On the other hand, the notion of Proof of Ownership (POW) has also been proposed to alleviate the cloud server from storing multiple copies of the same data, which could substantially reduce the consumption of both network bandwidth and server storage space. These two aspects are seemingly quite to the opposite of each other. In this paper, we show, somewhat surprisingly, that the two aspects can actually co-exist within the same framework. This is possible fundamentally because of the following insight: The public verifiability offered by PDP/POR schemes can be naturally exploited to achieve POW. This \"one stone, two birds\" phenomenon not only inspired us to propose the novel notion of Proof of Storage with Deduplication (POSD), but also guided us to design a concrete scheme that is provably secure in the Random Oracle model based on the Computational Diffie-Hellman (CDH) assumption.",

An attribute based encryption scheme (ABE), in contrast, is a scheme in which each user is identified by a set of attributes, and some function of those attributes is used to determine decryption ability for each ciphertext. Sahai and Waters introduced a single authority attribute encryption scheme and left open the question of whether a scheme could be constructed in which multiple authorities were allowed to distribute attributes [SW05]. We answer this question in the affirmative. \n \nOur scheme allows any polynomial number of independent authorities to monitor attributes and distribute secret keys. An encryptor can choose, for each authority, a number dk and a set of attributes; he can then encrypt a message such that a user can only decrypt if he has at least dk of the given attributes from each authority k. Our scheme can tolerate an arbitrary number of corrupt authoritites. \n \nWe also show how to apply our techniques to achieve a multiauthority version of the large universe fine grained access control ABE presented by Gopal et al.

      "abstract": "In this paper, we study of the notion of differing-input obfuscation, introduced by Barak et al. (CRYPTO 2001, JACM 2012). For any two circuits C0 and C1, a differing-input obfuscator diO guarantees that the non-existence of an adversary that can find an input on which C0 and C1 differ implies that diO(C0) and diO(C1) are computationally indistinguishable. We show many applications of this notion: We define the notion of a differing-input obfuscator for Turing machines and give a construction for the same (without converting it to a circuit) with input-specific running times. More specifically, for each input, our obfuscated Turning machine takes time proportional to the running time of the Turing machine on that specific input rather than the machine’s worst-case running time. We give a functional encryption scheme that allows for secret-keys to be associated with Turing machines, and thereby achieves input-specific running times. Further, we can equip our functional encryption scheme with delegation properties. We construct a multi-party non-interactive key exchange protocol with no trusted setup where all parties post only logarithmic-size messages. It is the first such scheme with such short messages. We similarly obtain a broadcast encryption system where the ciphertext overhead and secret-key size is constant (i.e. independent of the number of users), and the public key is logarithmic in the number of users. All our constructions make inherent use of the power provided by differing-input obfuscation. It is not currently known how to construct systems with these properties from the weaker notion of indistinguishability obfuscation.",

This improves upon several previous (incomparable) works which required either: (a) super-constant number of rounds, or, (b) non-standard or sub-exponential hardness assumptions, or, (c) non-black-box simulation and collision resistant hash functions. These constructions also allow us to obtain the first constant round multi-party computation protocol relying only on the existence of constant round oblivious transfer protocols. Our primary technique can be seen as a means of implementing the previous \"two-slot simulation\" idea in the area of non-malleability with only black-box simulation.\n A simple modification of our commitment scheme gives a construction which makes use of the underlying one-way function in a black-box way. The modified construction satisfies the notion of what we call non-malleability w.r.t. replacement. Non-malleability w.r.t. replacement is a slightly weaker yet natural notion of non-malleability which we believe suffices for many application of non-malleable commitments. We show that a commitment scheme which is non-malleable only w.r.t. replacement is sufficient to obtain a (fully) black-box multi-party computation protocol. This allows us to obtain a constant round multi-party computation protocol making only a black-box use of the standard cryptographic primitives with polynomial-time hardness thus directly improving upon the recent work of Wee (FOCS'10).",

      "abstract": "The problem of secure multiparty computation is usually described as follows: each of n players in a network holds a private input xi. Together they would like to compute a function F(x1,...,xn) without revealing the inputs, even though no particular player can be trusted. Attempts to contrive formal definitions for the problem have treated properties of the solution separately (correctness, privacy, etc.), giving an ad hoc collection of desirable properties and varied definitions that do not support clear or comparable proofs.We propose a clear, concise, and unified definition for security and reliability in interactive computations. We develop a reduction called relative resilience that captures all desired properties at a single blow. Relative resilience allows one to classify and compare arbitrary protocols in terms of security and reliability, in the same way that Turing reductions allow one to classify and compare algorithms in terms of complexity. Security and reliability reduce to a simple statement: a protocol for F is resilient if it is as resilient as an ideal protocol in which a trusted host is available to compute F. Relative resilience captures the notions of security and reliability for a wide variety of interactive computations, including zero-knowledge proof systems, Byzantine Agreement, oblivious transfer, two-party oblivious circuit evaluation, among others.Relative resilience provides modular proof techniques that other approaches lack: one may compare a sequence of protocols ranging from the real-world protocol to the ideal protocol, proving the relative resilience of each successive protocol with greater clarity and less complexity. Folk theorems about the \"transitivity\" of security and the security of concatenated protocols are now provable; and the proofs reveal that such folk theorems fail under subtle conditions that have previously gone unnoticed. The conciseness and modularity of our definitions and proof techniques provide great clarity in designing and reasoning about protocols and have already lead to provably secure protocols that are significantly more efficient than those appearing in the literature.",

Using error-correcting codes, and avoiding any computational assumptions in our constructions, we construct natural schemes that completely avoid any dependence on n in the transmission overhead. \n \nSpecifically, we construct: (i) (for illustrative purposes,) a randomized scheme where the server's storage is exponential (in n), but the transmission overhead is O(k), and each user's storage is O(kn); (ii) a scheme based on polynomials where the transmission overhead is O(kn) and each user's storage is O(kn); and (iii) a scheme using algebraic-geometric codes where the transmission overhead is O(k2) and each user is required to store O(kn) keys. In the process of proving these results, we show how to construct very good cover-free set systems and combinatorial designs based on algebraic-geometric codes, which may be of independent interest and application. \n \nOur approach also naturally extends to solve the problem in the case where the broadcast channel may introduce errors or lose information.",

It is quasi-adaptive in the sense that the common reference string CRS generator can generate the CRS depending on the language parameters. However, the simulation is required to be uniform, i.e., a single efficient simulator should work for the whole class of parametrized languages. For distributions on languages that are linear subspaces of vector spaces over bilinear groups, we give quasi-adaptive computationally sound NIZKs that are shorter and more efficient than Groth-Sahai NIZKs. For many cryptographic applications quasi-adaptive NIZKs suffice, and our constructions can lead to significant improvements in the standard model. Our construction can be based on any k-linear assumption, and in particular under the eXternal Diffie Hellman XDH assumption our proofs are even competitive with Random-Oracle based Σ-protocol NIZK proofs. \n \nWe also show that our system can be extended to include integer tags in the defining equations, where the tags are provided adaptively by the adversary. This leads to applicability of our system to many applications that use tags, e.g. applications using Cramer-Shoup projective hash proofs.

      "abstract": "In the area of privacy-preserving data mining, a differentially private mechanism intuitively encourages people to share their data because they are at little risk of revealing their own information. However, we argue that this interpretation is incomplete because external incentives are necessary for people to participate in databases, and so data release mechanisms should not only be differentially private but also compatible with incentives, otherwise the data collected may be false. We apply the notion of truthfulness from game theory to this problem. In certain settings, it turns out that existing differentially private mechanisms do not encourage participants to report their information truthfully.\n On the positive side, we exhibit a transformation that takes truthful mechanisms and transforms them into differentially private mechanisms that remain truthful. Our transformation applies to games where the type space is small and the goal is to optimize an insensitive quantity such as social welfare. Our transformation incurs only a small additive loss in optimality, and it is computationally efficient. Combined with the VCG mechanism, our transformation implies that there exists a differentially private, truthful, and approximately efficient mechanism for any social welfare game with small type space.\n We also study a model where an explicit numerical cost is assigned to the information leaked by a mechanism. We show that in this case, even differential privacy may not be strong enough of a notion to motivate people to participate truthfully. We show that mechanisms that release a perturbed histogram of the database may reveal too much information. We also show that, in general, any mechanism that outputs a synopsis that resembles the original database (such as the mechanism of Blum et al. (STOC '08)) may reveal too much information.",

The main cost measure for such a scheme is its communication complexity. In this paper we introduce a model of symmetrically-private information retrieval (SPIR), where the privacy of the data, as well as the privacy of the user, is guaranteed. That is, in every invocation of a SPIR protocol, the user learns only a single physical bit of x and no other information about the data. Previously known PIR schemes severely fail to meet this goal. We show how to transform PIR schemes into SPIR schemes (with information-theoretic privacy), paying a constant factor in communication complexity. To this end, we introduce and utilize a new cryptographic primitive, called conditional disclosure of secrets, which we believe may be a useful building block for the design of other cryptographic protocols. In particular, we get a k-database SPIR scheme of complexity O(n1/(2k?1)) for every constant k?2 and an O(logn)-database SPIR scheme of complexity O(log2n·loglogn). All our schemes require only a single round of interaction, and are resilient to any dishonest behavior of the user. These results also yield the first implementation of a distributed version of (n1)-OT (1-out-of-n oblivious transfer) with information-theoretic security and sublinear communication complexity.",

      "abstract": "An obfuscator is a compiler that transforms any program (which we will view in this work as a boolean circuit) into an obfuscated program (also a circuit) that has the same input-output functionality as the original program, but is \"unintelligible\". Obfuscation has applications for cryptography and for software protection. \n \nBarak et al. initiated a theoretical study of obfuscation, which focused on black-box obfuscation, where the obfuscated circuit should leak no information except for its (black-box) input-output functionality. A family of functionalities that cannot be obfuscated was demonstrated. Subsequent research has showed further negative results as well as positive results for obfuscating very specific families of circuits, all with respect to black box obfuscation. \n \nThis work is a study of a new notion of obfuscation, which we call best-possible obfuscation. Best possible obfuscation makes the relaxed requirement that the obfuscated program leaks as little information as any other program with the same functionality (and of similar size). In particular, this definition allows the program to leak non black-box information. Best-possible obfuscation guarantees that any information that is not hidden by the obfuscated program is also not hidden by any other similar-size program computing the same functionality, and thus the obfuscation is (literally) the best possible. In this work we study best-possible obfuscation and its relationship to previously studied definitions. Our main results are: 1. A separation between black-box and best-possible obfuscation. We show a natural obfuscation task that can be achieved under the best-possible definition, but cannot be achieved under the black-box definition. 2. A hardness result for best-possible obfuscation, showing that strong (information-theoretic) best-possible obfuscation implies a collapse in the polynomial hierarchy. 3. An impossibility result for efficient best-possible (and black-box) obfuscation in the presence of random oracles. This impossibility result uses a random oracle to construct hard-to-obfuscate circuits, and thus it does not imply impossibility in the standard model.",

We define an interactive oracle proof IOP to be an interactive proof in which the verifier is not required to read the prover's messages in their entirety; rather, the verifier has oracle access to the prover's messages, and may probabilistically query them. IOPs retain the expressiveness of PCPs, capturing NEXP rather than only PSPACE, and also the flexibility of IPs, allowing multiple rounds of communication with the prover. IOPs have already found several applications, including unconditional zero knowledge [BCGV16], constant-rate constant-query probabilistic checking [BCG+16], and doubly-efficient constant-round IPs for polynomial-time bounded-space computations [RRR16]. \n \nWe offer two main technical contributions. First, we give a compiler that maps any public-coin IOP into a non-interactive proof in the random oracle model. We prove that the soundness of the resulting proof is tightly characterized by the soundness of the IOP against state restoration attacks, a class of rewinding attacks on the IOP verifier that is reminiscent of, but incomparable to, resetting attacks. \n \nSecond, we study the notion of state-restoration soundness of an IOP: we prove tight upper and lower bounds in terms of the IOP's standard soundness and round complexity; and describe a simple adversarial strategy that is optimal, in expectation, across all state restoration attacks. \n \nOur compiler can be viewed as a generalization of the Fiat---Shamir paradigm for public-coin IPs CRYPTOi¾?'86, and of the \"CS proof\" constructions of Micali FOCSi¾?'94 and Valiant TCCi¾?'08 for PCPs. Our analysis of the compiler gives, in particular, a unified understanding of these constructions, and also motivates the study of state restoration attacks, not only for IOPs, but also for IPs and PCPs. \n \nWhen applied to known IOP constructions, our compiler implies, e.g., blackbox unconditional ZK proofs in the random oracle model with quasilinear prover and polylogarithmic verifier, improving on a result of [IMSX15].",

We take the approach of exploiting problem structure to achieve better results, by providing a geometry-inspired algorithm whose approximation guarantee depends solely on an instance-specific combinatorial property known as shallow cell complexity (SCC). Roughly speaking, a set cover instance has low SCC if any column-induced submatrix of the corresponding element-set incidence matrix has few distinct rows. By adapting and improving Varadarajan's recent quasi-uniform random sampling method for weighted geometric covering problems, we obtain strong approximation algorithms for a structurally rich class of weighted covering problems with low SCC. We also show how to derandomize our algorithm. \n \nOur main result has several immediate consequences. Among them, we settle an open question of Chakrabarty et al. [8] by showing that weighted instances of the capacitated covering problem with underlying network structure have O(1)-approximations. Additionally, our improvements to Varadarajan's sampling framework yield several new results for weighted geometric set cover, hitting set, and dominating set problems. In particular, for weighted covering problems exhibiting linear (or near-linear) union complexity, we obtain approximability results agreeing with those known for the unweighted case. For example, we obtain a constant approximation for the weighted disk cover problem, improving upon the 2O(log* n)-approximation known prior to our work and matching the O(1)-approximation known for the unweighted variant.",

Identity-based encryption schemes are public key encryption schemes that can use arbitrary strings as public keys. We propose the first public key broadcast encryption scheme that can use any string as a public key of each receiver. That is, identity-based broadcast encryption scheme. Our scheme has many desirable properties. The scheme is fully collusion resistant, and the size of ciphertexts and that of private key are small constants. The size of public key is proportional to only the maximum number of receiver sets to each of which the ciphertext is sent. Note that its size remains to be so although the number of potential receivers is super-polynomial size. Besides these properties, the achieving the first practical identity-based broadcast encryption scheme itself is the most interesting point of this paper.

This new construction provides the first example of threshold cryptosystem secure against chosen-ciphertext attacks based on the factorization problem. Moreover, this construction provides a scheme where the \"homomorphic properties\" of the original scheme still hold.

Most existing protocols rely on proofs-of-work which require expensive computational puzzles to enforce, imprecisely speaking, “one vote per unit of computation”. The enormous amount of energy wasted by these protocols has been a topic of central debate, and well-known cryptocurrencies have announced it a top priority to alternative paradigms. Among the proposed alternative solutions, proofs-of-stake protocols have been of particular interest, where roughly speaking, the idea is to enforce “one vote per unit of stake”. Although the community have rushed to propose numerous candidates for proofs-of-stake, no existing protocol has offered formal proofs of security, which we believe to be a critical, indispensible ingredient of a distributed consensus protocol, particularly one that is to underly a high-value cryptocurrency system. In this work, we seek to address the following basic questions: • What kind of functionalities and robustness requirements should a consensus candidate offer to be suitable in a proof-of-stake application? • Can we design a provably secure protocol that satisfies these requirements? To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to formally articulate a set of requirements for consensus candidates for proofs-of-stake. We argue that any consensus protocol satisfying these properties can be used for proofs-of-stake, as long as money does not switch hands too quickly.

In this work we give the first such construction in the random oracle model. The demonstration of an efficient construction proven secure in a formal model that captures all intuitive security properties of a certain primitive is a basic goal in cryptographic design. To this end we adapt a formal model for group signatures capturing all the basic requirements that have been identified as desirable in the area and we construct an efficient scheme and prove its security. Our construction is based on the Strong-RSA assumption (as in the work of Ateniese et al.). In our system, due to the requirements of provable security in a formal model, we give novel constructions as well as innovative extensions of the underlying mathematical requirements and properties. Our task, in fact, requires the investigation of some basic number-theoretic techniques for arguing security over the group of quadratic residues modulo a composite when its factorization is known. Along the way we discover that in the basic construction, anonymity does not depend on factoring-based assumptions, which, in turn, allows the natural separation of user join management and anonymity revocation authorities. Anonymity can, in turn, be shown even against an adversary controlling the join manager. ∗Research partly supported by NSF Career Award CNS-0447808.",

We then give an alternative definition in terms of games that also seems to capture the necessary properties one may expect from a signature of knowledge. We then gain additional confidence in our two definitions by proving them equivalent. \n \nWe construct signatures of knowledge under standard complexity assumptions in the common-random-string model. \n \nWe then extend our definition to allow signatures of knowledge to be nested i.e., a signature of knowledge (or another accepting input to a UC-realizable ideal functionality) can itself serve as a witness for another signature of knowledge.

When used with Paillier's cryptosystem, this framework allows for efficient secure evaluation of any arithmetic circuit defined over ℤN, where N is the RSA modulus of the underlying Paillier cryptosystem. \n \nIn this paper, we extend the scope of the framework by considering the problem of converting a given Paillier encryption of a value x∈ℤN into Paillier encryptions of the bits of x. We present solutions for the general case in which x can be any integer in {0,1,...,N – 1}, and for the restricted case in which x < N/(n2κ) for a security parameter κ. In the latter case, we show how to extract the l least significant bits of x (in encrypted form) in time proportional to l, typically saving a factor of log2N /l compared to the general case. \n \nThus, intermediate computations that rely in an essential way on the binary representations of their input values can be handled without enforcing that the entire computation is done bitwise.

A user can encrypt data in terms of any boolean formula over attributes issued from any chosen set of authorities. Finally, our system does not require any central authority. \n \nIn constructing our system, our largest technical hurdle is to make it collusion resistant. Prior Attribute-Based Encryption systems achieved collusion resistance when the ABE system authority \"tied\" together different components (representing different attributes) of a user's private key by randomizing the key. However, in our system each component will come from a potentially different authority, where we assume no coordination between such authorities. We create new techniques to tie key components together and prevent collusion attacks between users with different global identifiers. \n \nWe prove our system secure using the recent dual system encryption methodology where the security proof works by first converting the challenge ciphertext and private keys to a semi-functional form and then arguing security.

We first show feasibility of obtaining complete fairness when computing any function over polynomial-size domains that does not contain an “embedded XOR”; this class of functions includes boolean AND/OR as well as Yao’s “millionaires’ problem”.

Thus, for typical large-scale computations whose circuit width is much bigger than their depth and the number of players, the amortized overhead is just polylogarithmic in n and s. The protocol provides perfect security with guaranteed output delivery in the presence of an active, adaptive adversary corrupting a (1/3−e) fraction of the players, for an arbitrary constant e>0 and sufficiently large n. The best previous protocols in this setting could only offer computational security with a computational overhead of poly(k,logn,logs), where k is a computational security parameter, or perfect security with a computational overhead of $\\mathcal{O}(n\\log n)$. \n \nWe then apply the above result towards making progress on the second question. Concretely, under standard cryptographic assumptions, we obtain zero-knowledge proofs for circuit satisfiability with 2−k soundness error in which the amortized computational overhead per gate is only polylogarithmic in k, improving over the ω(k) overhead of the best previous protocols.

If there are other parties that can help in transmitting the data, we also construct a sender-and-receiver-deniable scheme from any sender-deniable scheme. We describe the constructions with respect to schemes that encrypt only one bit at a time. Generalizing these constructions to schemes that encrypt arbitrarily long messages is straightforward. These constructions apply to both shared-key and public-key settings. Receiver-deniability from Sender-deniability. Assume a sender-deniable encryption scheme A, and construct the following scheme B. Let b denote the bit to be transmitted from S to R. First R chooses a random bit r, and invokes the scheme A to send r to S. (That is, with respect to scheme A, R is the sender and S is the receiver.) Next, S sends b r to R, in the clear. If scheme A is sender-deniable then, when attacked, R can convincingly claim that the value of r was either 0 or 1, as desired. Consequently R can claim that the bit b was either 0 or 1, at wish, and scheme B is receiver-deniable. Sender-deniability from Receiver-deniability. We use the exact same construction. It is easy to verify that if A is receiver-deniable then B is sender-deniable. Sender-and-receiver-deniability. Assume that S and R can use other parties I1; :::; In as intermediaries in their communication. The following scheme is resilient against attacking the sender, the receiver and some intermediaries, as long as at least one intermediary remains unattacked. In order to transmit a bit b to R, S rst chooses n bits b1:::bn such that ibi = b. Next, S transmits bi to each intermediary Ii, using a sender-deniable scheme. Next, each Ii transmits bi to R using a receiverdeniable scheme. Finally R computes ibi = b. When an intermediary Ii is attacked, it reveals the true value of bi. However, as long as one intermediary Ij remains unattacked, both S and R can convincingly claim, when attacked, that the value of bj (and consequently the value of b) is either 0 or 1. Note that this scheme works only if the parties can `coordinate their stories', in the sense of Remark 2 to De nition 10. In particular, the sender and receiver must know, when attacked, which intermediaries are being attacked.4 References [1] M. Ajtai, Generating Hard Instances of Lattice Problems, STOC'96 [2] M.

A An Alternative Non-Committing Encryption Scheme Recently, general multiparty protocols secure against an adaptive adversary that corrupts parties based on past information were constructed [7]. At the heart of this construction is another type of encryption protocol, called non-committing encryptions. As in the case of deniable encryption, non-committing encryption is concerned with foiling an adversary that registers the ciphertext and later asks the sender and receiver to reveal their secret keys and random choices. Non-committing encryption o ers a considerably weaker solution to this problem than deniable encryption, (although non-committing encryption su ce for proving adaptive security.) Very roughly, a non-committing encryption scheme consists of the usual key-generation, encryption, and decryption algorithms that ensure correctness and semantic security, with the following extra property: There exists a simulator that simulates the process of encryption and decryption in a deniable. That is, the simulator rst generates dummy ciphertexts that are indistinguishable, in the eyes of the adversary, from authentic 12 ciphertexts. Next, when the adversary asks to see the internal data of the sender and the receiver, the simulator is able to choose an arbitrary cleartext and then present the adversary with data that is consistent the chosen cleartext. Note that in a non-committing scheme only the simulator can generate `dummy ciphertexts' that can be `opened' as encryptions of more than one value. The sender and receiver are unable to do so. Furthermore, the dummy ciphertexts of a non-committing scheme need not have meaningful decryption, whereas in deniable encryption each ciphertext has unique, meaningful decryption and at the same time can be opened in several ways for an adversary. In particular the non-committing scheme described in [7] is not deniable. Any public-key (n)-sender-and-receiver-deniable encryption scheme according to De nition 10 is noncommitting if (n) is negligible. However, we do not know if such a deniable scheme exists. (In this paper we only describe 1 nc -sender-and-receiver-deniable schemes, we're c is a constant.) It turns out, however, that the basic scheme described in Section 3, after being transformed into a sender-and-receiver-deniable scheme using the technique of Section 6, is a valid non-committing encryption scheme. In particular, this scheme is much simpler to present and prove than the [7] scheme. Call this scheme the transformed basic scheme. To show that the transformed basic scheme is non-committing, we have to describe the simulator. We use the fact that, in the basic scheme, cheating is undetectable in one direction (except for negligible probability). That is, the sender can encrypt 1 and later claim that the encrypted bit was 0. The dummy ciphertexts generated by the simulator will all be legal encryptions of 1. When, in a simulated execution, the sender and receiver are asked to demonstrate their internal data they can show that the encrypted bit was either 0 or 1, as desired. B De nitions 9 and 10 De nition 9 A protocol with sender S and receiver R, and with security parameter n is a (n)-receiverdeniable encryption protocol if it satis es De nition 2, with the exception that the Deniability property is replaced as follows. Deniability: There exists an e cient faking algorithm having the following property with respect to any m1; m2 2 M . Let rS ; rR be uniformly chosen random inputs of S and R, respectively, let c = com (m1; rS; rR), and let ~ rR = (m1; rR; c;m2). Then, the random variables (m2; ~ rR; c) and (m2; rR;com (m2; rS; rR)) are (n)-close. De nition 10 A protocol with sender S and receiver R, and with security parameter n is a (n)-senderand-receiver-deniable encryption protocol if it satis es De nition 2, with the exception that the Deniability property is replaced as follows. Deniability: There exist two e cient faking algorithms S and R having the following property with respect to any m1; m2 2 M . Let rS ; rR be uniformly chosen random inputs of S and R, respectively, let c = com (m1; rS; rR), let ~ rS = S(m1; rS; c;m2), and let ~ rR = R(m1; rR; c;m2). Then, the random variables (m2; ~ rS; ~ rR; c) and (m2; rS; rR;com (m2; rS; rR)) are (n)-close. 13 Remarks: 1. Note that the requirement from a sender-and-receiver-deniable encryption protocol is stronger than requiring that the protocol be both sender-deniable and receiver-deniable. 2. De nition 10 does not address the following issue. In order for the sender and the receiver to convince an adversary that attacks both, the parties need to have `consistent stories'. That is, they both should claim the same (fake or true) value for the cleartext. We believe that this `coordination' issue should be treated separately. (Indeed, it is extensively treated in [5].) Note that this issue does not appear when only the sender or only the receiver are attacked. 14",

In this scenario, the client must be able to efficiently verify the correctness of the result despite no longer knowing the inputs of the delegated computation, it must be able to keep adding elements to its remote storage, and it does not have to fix in advance (i.e., at data outsourcing time) the functions that it will delegate. Even more ambitiously, clients should be able to verify in time independent of the input-size -- a very appealing property for computations over huge amounts of data.\n In this work we propose novel cryptographic techniques that solve the above problem for the class of computations of quadratic polynomials over a large number of variables. This class covers a wide range of significant arithmetic computations -- notably, many important statistics. To confirm the efficiency of our solution, we show encouraging performance results, e.g., correctness proofs have size below 1 kB and are verifiable by clients in less than 10 milliseconds.",

      "abstract": "The Universal Composability framework was introduced by Canetti to study the security of protocols which are concurrently executed with other protocols in a network environment. Unfortunately it was shown that in the so called plain model, a large class of functionalities cannot be securely realized. These severe impossibility results motivated the study of other models involving some sort of setup assumptions, where general positive results can be obtained. Until recently, all the setup assumptions which were proposed required some trusted third party (or parties). \n \nKatz recently proposed using a physical setup to avoid such trusted setup assumptions. In his model, the physical setup phase includes the parties exchanging tamper proof hardware tokens implementing some functionality. The tamper proof hardware is modeled so as to assume that the receiver of the token can do nothing more than observe its input/output characteristics. It is further assumed that the sender knows the program code of the hardware token which it distributed. Based on the DDH assumption, Katz gave general positive results for universally composable multi-party computation tolerating any number of dishonest parties making this model quite attractive. \n \nIn this paper, we present new constructions for UC secure computation using tamper proof hardware (in a stronger model). Our results represent an improvement over the results of Katz in several directions using substantially different techniques. Interestingly, our security proofs do not rely on being able to rewind the hardware tokens created by malicious parties. This means that we are able to relax the assumptions that the parties know the code of the hardware token which they distributed. This allows us to model real life attacks where, for example, a party may simply pass on the token obtained from one party to the other without actually knowing its functionality. Furthermore, our construction models the interaction with the tamper-resistant hardware as a simple request-reply protocol. Thus, we show that the hardware tokens used in our construction can be resettable. In fact, it suffices to use token which are completely stateless (and thus cannot execute a multiround protocol). Our protocol is also based on general assumptions (namely enhanced trapdoor permutations).",

In this paper, we consider SPS systems with homomorphic properties and suggest applications that have not been provided before (in particular, not by employing ordinary SPS). We build linearly homomorphic structure-preserving signatures under simple assumptions and show that the primitive makes it possible to verify the calculations performed by a server on outsourced encrypted data (i.e., combining secure computation and authenticated computation to allow reliable and secure cloud storage and computation, while freeing the client from retaining cleartext storage).

Algorand ensures that users never have divergent views of confirmed transactions, even if some of the users are malicious and the network is temporarily partitioned. In contrast, existing cryptocurrencies allow for temporary forks and therefore require a long time, on the order of an hour, to confirm transactions with high confidence.\n Algorand uses a new Byzantine Agreement (BA) protocol to reach consensus among users on the next set of transactions. To scale the consensus to many users, Algorand uses a novel mechanism based on Verifiable Random Functions that allows users to privately check whether they are selected to participate in the BA to agree on the next set of transactions, and to include a proof of their selection in their network messages. In Algorand's BA protocol, users do not keep any private state except for their private keys, which allows Algorand to replace participants immediately after they send a message. This mitigates targeted attacks on chosen participants after their identity is revealed.\n We implement Algorand and evaluate its performance on 1,000 EC2 virtual machines, simulating up to 500,000 users. Experimental results show that Algorand confirms transactions in under a minute, achieves 125x Bitcoin's throughput, and incurs almost no penalty for scaling to more users.",

We then show how this protocol can be used in conjunction with other existing constructions in order to obtain a constant-round protocol for securely computing any two-party functionality.

      "abstract": "We investigate protocols for authenticated exchange of messages between two parties in a communication network. Secure authenticated exchange is essential for network security. It is not difficult to design simple and seemingly correct solutions for it, however, many such 'solutions' can be broken. We give some examples of such protocols and we show a useful methodology which can be used to break many protocols. In particular, we break a protocol that is being standardized by the ISO.We present a new authenticated exchange protocol which is both provably secure and highly efficient and practical. The security of the protocol is proven, based on an assumption about the the cryptosystem employed (namely, that it is secure when used in CBC mode on a certain message space). We think that this assumption is quite reasonable for many cryptosystems, and furthermore it is often assumed in practical use of the DES cryptosystem. Our protocol cannot be broken using the methodology we present (which was strong enough to catch all protocol flaws we found). The reduction to the security of the encryption mode, indeed captures the non-existence of the exposures that the methodology catches (specialized to the actual use of encryption in our protocol). Furthermore, the protocol prevents chosen plaintext or ciphertext attacks on the cryptosystem.The proposed protocol is efficient and practical in several aspects. First, it uses only conventional cryptography (like the DES, or any privately-shared one-way function) and no public-key. Second, the protocol does not require synchronized clocks or counter management. Third, only a small number of encryption operations is needed (we use no decryption), all with a single shared key. In addition, only three messages are exchanged during the protocol, and the size of these messages is minimal. These properties are similar to existing and proposed actual protocols. This is essential for integration of the proposed protocol into existing systems and embedding it in existing communication protocols.",

The first plausible construction of such multilinear maps has recently been described by Garg, Gentry and Halevi, based on ideal lattices. In this paper we describe a different construction that works over the integers instead of ideal lattices, similar to the DGHV fully homomorphic encryption scheme. We also describe a different technique for proving the full randomization of encodings: instead of Gaussian linear sums, we apply the classical leftover hash lemma over a quotient lattice. We show that our construction is relatively practical: for reasonable security parameters a one-round 7-party Diffie-Hellman key exchange requires less than 40 seconds per party. Moreover, in contrast with previous work, multilinear analogues of useful, base group assumptions like DLIN appear to hold in our setting.",

      "abstract": "A well-known fact in the theory of secret sharing schemes is that shares must be of length at least as the secret itself. However, the proof of this lower bound uses the notion of information theoretic secrecy. A natural (and very practical) question is whether one can do better for secret sharing if the notion of secrecy is computational, namely, against resource bounded adversaries. In this note we observe that, indeed, one can do much better in the computational model (which is the one used in most applications).We present an m-threshold scheme, where m shares recover the secret but m - 1 shares give no (computational) information on the secret, in which shares corresponding to a secret S are of size |S|/m plus a short piece of information whose length does not depend on the secret size but just in the security parameter. (The bound of |S|/m is clearly optimal if the secret is to be recovered from m shares). Therefore, for moderately large secrets (a confidential file, a long message, a large data base) the savings in space and communication over traditional schemes is remarkable.The scheme is very simple and combines in a natural way traditional (perfect) secret sharing schemes, encryption, and information dispersal. It is provable secure given a secure (e.g., private key) encryption function.",

Using the operations of composition and fixpoints, a Σ-Π hierarchy of height, ω2, called the fixpoint query hierarchy, is defined, and its properties investigated. The hierarchy includes most of the queries considered in the literature including those of Codd and Aho and Ullman. The hierarchy to level ω characterizes the first-order queries, and the levels up to ω are shown to be strict. Sets of queries larger than the fixpoint query hierarchy are obtained by considering the queries computable in polynomial time, queries computable in polynomial space, etc. It is shown that classes of queries defined from such complexity classes behave (with respect to containment) in a manner very similar to the corresponding complexity classes. Also, the set of second-order queries turns out to be the same as the set of queries defined from the polynomialtime hierarchy. Finally, these classes of queries are used to characterize a set of queries defined from language considerations: those expressible in a programming language with only typed (or ranked) relation variables.

      "abstract": "The Log-structured File System (LFS), introduced in 1991 [8], has received much attention for its potential order-of-magnitude improvement in file system performance. Early research results [9] showed that small file performance could scale with processor speed and that cleaning costs could be kept low, allowing LFS to write at an effective bandwidth of 62 to 83% of the maximum. Later work showed that the presence of synchronous disk operations could degrade performance by as much as 62% and that cleaning overhead could become prohibitive in transaction processing workloads, reducing performance by as much as 40% [10]. The same work showed that the addition of clustered reads and writes in the Berkeley Fast File System [6] (FFS) made it competitive with LFS in large-file handling and software development environments as approximated by the Andrew benchmark [4]. \n \nThese seemingly inconsistent results have caused confusion in the file system research community. This paper presents a detailed performance comparison of the 4.4BSD Log-structured File System and the 4.4BSD Fast File System. Ignoring cleaner overhead, our results show that the order-of-magnitude improvement in performance claimed for LFS applies only to meta-data intensive activities, specifically the creation of files one-kilobyte or less and deletion of files 64 kilobytes or less. \n \nFor small files, both systems provide comparable read performance, but LFS offers superior performance on writes. For large files (one megabyte and larger), the performance of the two file systems is comparable. When FFS is tuned for writing, its large-file write performance is approximately 15% better than LFS, but its read performance is 25% worse. When FFS is optimized for reading, its large-file read and write performance is comparable to LFS. \n \nBoth LFS and FFS can suffer performance degradation, due to cleaning and disk fragmentation respectively. We find that active FFS file systems function at approximately 85-95% of their maximum performance after two to three years. We examine LFS cleaner performance in a transaction processing environment and find that cleaner overhead reduces LFS performance by more than 33% when the disk is 50% full.",

Garbled circuits found numerous applications, but every known construction suffers from one limitation: it offers no security if used on multiple inputs x. In this paper, we construct for the first time  reusable garbled circuits. The key building block is a new succinct single-key functional encryption scheme.\n Functional encryption is an ambitious primitive: given an encryption Enc(x) of a value x, and a secret key sk_f for a function f, anyone can compute f(x) without learning any other information about x. We construct, for the first time, a succinct functional encryption scheme for {\\em any} polynomial-time function f where succinctness means that the ciphertext size does not grow with the size of the circuit for f, but only with its depth. The security of our construction is based on the intractability of the Learning with Errors (LWE) problem and holds as long as an adversary has access to a single key sk_f (or even an a priori bounded number of keys for different functions).\n Building on our succinct single-key functional encryption scheme, we show several new applications in addition to reusable garbled circuits, such as a paradigm for general function obfuscation which we call token-based obfuscation, homomorphic encryption for a class of Turing machines where the evaluation runs in input-specific time rather than worst-case time, and a scheme for delegating computation which is publicly verifiable and maintains the privacy of the computation.",

      "abstract": "Protocol reverse engineering has often been a manual process that is considered time-consuming, tedious and error-prone. To address this limitation, a number of solutions have recently been proposed to allow for automatic protocol reverse engineering. Unfortunately, they are either limited in extracting protocol fields due to lack of program semantics in network traces or primitive in only revealing the flat structure of protocol format. In this paper, we present a system called AutoFormat that aims at not only extracting protocol fields with high accuracy, but also revealing the inherently “non-flat”, hierarchical structures of protocol messages. AutoFormat is based on the key insight that different protocol fields in the same message are typically handled in different execution contexts (e.g., the runtime call stack). As such, by monitoring the program execution, we can collect the execution context information for every message byte (annotated with its offset in the entire message) and cluster them to derive the protocol format. We have evaluated our system with more than 30 protocol messages from seven protocols, including two text-based protocols (HTTP and SIP), three binary-based protocols (DHCP, RIP, and OSPF), one hybrid protocol (CIFS/SMB), as well as one unknown protocol used by a real-world malware. Our results show that AutoFormat can not only identify individual message fields automatically and with high accuracy (an average 93.4% match ratio compared with Wireshark), but also unveil the structure of the protocol format by revealing possible relations (e.g., sequential, parallel, and hierarchical) among the message fields. ∗Part of this research has been supported by the National Science Foundation under grants CNS-0716376 and CNS-0716444.

In particular, Miles, Sahai and Zhandry Crypto'16 recently gave a polynomial-time attack on several iO candidates when instantiated with the multilinear maps of Garg, Gentry, and Halevi Eurocrypt'13, and also proposed a new \"weak multilinear map model\" that captures all known polynomial-time attacks on GGH13. \n \nIn this work, we give a new iO candidate which can be seen as a small modification or generalization of the original candidate of Garg, Gentry, Halevi, Raykova, Sahai, and Waters FOCS'13. We prove its security in the weak multilinear map model, thus giving the first iO candidate that is provably secure against all known polynomial-time attacks on GGH13.

      "abstract": "At the end of 2011, Google released version 4.0 of its Android operating system for smartphones. For the first time, Android smartphone owners were supplied with a disk encryption feature that transparently encrypts user partitions. On the downside, encrypted smartphones are a nightmare for IT forensics and law enforcement, because brute force appears to be the only option to recover encrypted data by technical means. However, RAM contents are necessarily left unencrypted and, as we show, they can be acquired from live systems with physical access only. To this end, we present the data recovery tool Frost (Forensic Recovery of Scrambled Telephones). Using Galaxy Nexus devices from Samsung as an example, we show that it is possible to perform cold boot attacks against Android smartphones and to retrieve valuable information from RAM. This information includes personal messages, photos, passwords and the encryption key. Since smartphones get switched off only seldom, and since the tools that we provide must not be installed before the attack, our method can be applied in real cases.",

Our core tool is a new procedure called ciphertext delegation that allows a ciphertext to be 're-encrypted' to a more restrictive policy using only public information.Second, we study the problem of revocable attribute-based encryption. We provide the first fully secure construction by modifying an attribute-based encryption scheme due to Lewko et al. [9] and prove security in the standard model. \n \nWe then combine these two results for a new approach for revocation on stored data.

AE is a much stronger notion than the traditional IND---CCA. One shortcoming of AE as commonly understood is its idealized, all-or-nothing decryption: if decryption fails, it will always provide the same single error message and nothing more. Reality often turns out differently: encode-then-encipher schemes often output decrypted ciphertext before verification has taken place whereas pad-then-MAC-then-encrypt schemes are prone to distinguishable verification failures due to the subtle interaction between padding and the MAC-then-encrypt concept. Three recent papers provided what appeared independent and radically different definitions to model this type of decryption leakage. \n \nWe reconcile these three works by providing a reference model of security for authenticated encryption in the face of decryption leakage from invalid queries. Having tracked the development of AE security games, we provide a single expressive framework allowing us to compare and contrast the previous notions. We find that at their core, the notions are essentially equivalent, with their key differences stemming from definitional choices independent of the desire to capture real world behaviour.",

      "abstract": "The availability of vast amounts of data is changing how we can make medical discoveries, predict global market trends, save energy, improve our infrastructures, and develop new educational strategies. One obstacle to this revolution is the willingness of different entities to share their data with others. The theory of secure multiparty computation (MPC) seemingly addresses this problem in the best way possible. Namely, parties learn the minimum necessary information: the value of the function computed on their joint data and nothing else. However, the theory of MPC does not deal with an important aspect: when do different players receive their output? In time-sensitive applications, the timing and order of output discovery may be another important deciding factor in whether parties choose to share their data via the MPC. In this work, we incorporate time and order of output delivery into the theory of MPC. We first extend classical MPC to ordered MPC where different players receive their outputs according to an order which in itself is computed on the inputs to the protocol, and to refine the classical notions of guaranteed output delivery and fairness to require instead ordered output delivery and prefix-fairness. We then define timed-delay MPCs where explicit time delays are introduced into the output delivery schedule. We show general completeness theorems for ordered MPCs and timed-delay MPCs. We also introduce a new primitive called time-line puzzles, which are a natural extension of classical timed-release crypto, in which multiple events can be serialized in time. Next, we show how ordered MPC can give rise to MPCs which are provably “worth” joining, in competitive settings where relative time of output discovery may deter parties from joining the protocol. We formalize a model of collaboration and design a mechanism in which n selfinterested parties can decide, based on their inputs, on an ordering of output delivery and a distribution of outputs to be delivered in the mandated order. The mechanism guarantees a higher reward for all participants when joining an ordered MPC or declares that such a guarantee is impossible to achieve. We show a polynomial time algorithm to compute the mechanism for a range of model settings.",

The cost of the tree is the total length of edges in the tree, and we want this cost to be close to the cost of the optimal Steiner tree at all points in time. If we are allowed to only add edges, a tight bound of Θ(log n) on the competitiveness has been known for two decades. Recently it was shown that if we can add one new edge and make one edge swap upon every vertex arrival, we can still maintain a constant-competitive tree online. \n \nBut what if the set of vertices sees both additions and deletions? Again, we would like to obtain a low-cost Steiner tree with as few edge changes as possible. The original paper of Imase and Waxman (SIAM J. Disc. Math, 4(3): 369--384, 1991) had also considered this model, and it gave an algorithm that made at most O(n3/2) edge changes for the first n requests, and maintained a constant-competitive tree online. In this paper we improve on these results: \n \n• We give an online algorithm that maintains a Steiner tree under only deletions: we start off with a set of vertices, and at each time one of the vertices is removed from this set---our Steiner tree no longer has to span this vertex. We give an algorithm that changes only a constant number of edges upon each request, and maintains a constant-competitive tree at all times. Our algorithm uses the primal-dual framework and a global charging argument to carefully make these constant number of changes. \n \n• We also give an algorithm that maintains a Steiner tree in the fully-dynamic model (where each request either adds or deletes a vertex). Our algorithm for this setting makes a constant number of changes per request in an amortized sense.",

At CRYPTO 2013, Gentry, Sahai and Waters largely settled the problem by presenting leveled IBFHE constructions based on the Learning With Errors problem. However their constructions are not bootstrappable, and as a result, are not \"pure\" IBFHE schemes. The major challenge with bootstrapping in the identity-based setting is that it must be possible to non-interactively derive from the public parameters an \"encryption\" of the secret key for an arbitrary identity. All presently-known leveled IBFHE schemes only allow bootstrapping if such an \"encryption\" of the secret key is supplied out-of-band. In this work, we present a \"pure\" IBFHE scheme from indistinguishability obfuscation, and extend the result to the attribute-based setting. Our attribute-based scheme is the first to support homomorphic evaluation on ciphertexts with different attributes. Finally, we characterize presently-known leveled IBFHE schemes with a view to developing a \"compiler\" from a leveled IBFHE scheme to a bootstrappable IBFHE scheme, and sufficient conditions are identified.",

Another example would be an argument system without perfect completeness.

We give the first proof that parallel repetition with thresholds improves the security of such protocols.

In this paper, we describe how to selectively collect the forensic evidence of good quality from observable and protective hosts at the time of infringement occurrence by malicious users. By correlating the event logs of Intrusion Detection Systems(IDSes) and hosts with the configuration information of hosts periodically, we calculate the value of infringement severity that implies the real infringement possibility of the hosts. Based on this severity value, we selectively collect the evidence for proofs at the time of infringement occurrence.

However, the shares' size in the best known secret-sharing schemes realizing general access structures is exponential in the number of parties in the access structure, making them impractical. On the other hand, the best lower bound known for sharing of an l-bit secret with respect to an access structure with n parties is ω(ln/ log n) (Csirmaz, EUROCRYPT 94). No major progress on closing this gap has been obtained in the last decade. \n \nFaced by our lack of understanding of the share complexity of secret sharing schemes, we investigate a weaker notion of privacy in secrets sharing schemes where each unauthorized set can never rule out any secret (rather than not learn any \"probabilistic\" information on the secret). Such schemes were used previously to prove lower bounds on the shares' size of perfect secret-sharing schemes. Our main results is somewhat surprising upper-bounds on the shares' size in weakly-private schemes. - For every access structure, we construct a scheme for sharing an l-bit secret with (l+c)-bit shares, where c is a constant depending on the access structure (alas, c can be exponential in n). Thus, our schemes become more efficient as l - the secret size - grows. For example, for the above mentioned access structure of Csirmaz, we construct a scheme with shares' size l + n log n. - We construct efficient weakly-private schemes for threshold access structures for sharing a one bit secret. Most impressively, for the 2- out-of-n threshold access structure, we construct a scheme with 2-bit shares (compared to ω(log n) in any perfect secret sharing scheme).",

These results hold both for the case of general composition (where a secure protocol is run many times concurrently with arbitrary other protocols) and self-composition (where a single secure protocol is run many times concurrently). In this paper we investigate the feasibility of obtaining security in the concurrent setting, assuming that each party has a local clock and that these clocks proceed at approximately the same rate. We show that under this mild timing assumption, it is possible to securely compute any multiparty functionality under concurrent self-composition. Loosely speaking, we also show that it is possible to securely compute any multiparty functionality under concurrent general composition, as long as the secure protocol is run only with protocols whose messages are delayed by a specified amount of time. On the negative side, we show that it is impossible to achieve security under concurrent general composition with no restrictions whatsoever on the network (like the aforementioned delays), even in the timing model.",

When combined with hardness properties such as one-wayness or collision-resistance, extractability has proven to be a powerful tool. However, so far, extractability has not been explicitly shown. Instead, it has only been considered as a non-standard knowledge assumption on certain functions.\n We make two headways in the study of the existence of extractable one-way functions (EOWFs). On the negative side, we show that if there exist indistinguishability obfuscators for a certain class of circuits then there do not exist EOWFs where extraction works for any adversarial program with auxiliary-input of unbounded polynomial length.\n On the positive side, for adversarial programs with bounded auxiliary input (and unbounded polynomial running time), we give the first construction of EOWFs with an explicit extraction procedure, based on relatively standard assumptions (e.g., sub-exponential hardness of Learning with Errors). We then use these functions to construct the first 2-message zero-knowledge arguments and 3-message zero-knowledge arguments of knowledge, against the same class of adversarial verifiers, from essentially the same assumptions.",

This property is interesting for at least two reasons: first, because of its seeming artificiality (no standard model hash function is known to support such adaptive programming); second, the only known security reductions for many important cryptographic schemes rely fundamentally on programming. We provide formal tools to study the role of programmability in provable security. This includes a framework describing three levels of programming in reductions (none, limited, and full). We then prove that no black-box reductions can be given for FDH signatures when only limited programming is allowed, giving formal support for the intuition that full programming is fundamental to the provable security of FDH.We also show that Shoup’s trapdoor-permutation-based key-encapsulation is provably CCA-secure with limited programmability, but no black-box reduction succeeds when no programming at all is permitted. Our negative results use a new concrete-security variant of Hsiao and Reyzin’s two-oracle separation technique.",

We formulate such notion under a security model called Proofs of Data Residency (PoDR). can be employed to check whether the data are replicated across different storage servers, or combined with storage server geolocation to \"locate\" the data in the cloud. We make key observations that the data residency checking protocol should exclude all server-side computation and that each challenge should ask for no more than a single atomic fetching operation. We illustrate challenges and subtleties in protocol design by showing potential attacks to naive constructions. Next, we present a secure PoDR scheme structured as a timed challenge-response protocol. Two implementation variants of the proposed solution, namely NVeri and EVeri, describe an interesting use-case of trusted computing, in particular the use of Intel SGX, in cryptographic timed challenge-response protocols whereby having the verifier co-locating with the prover offers security enhancement.

The new scheme offers a simpler alternative to the best previously known (static) proactive RSA scheme given by Tal Rabin [36], itself a simplification over the previous schemes given by Frankel et al. [18,17]. The new scheme is conceptually simple because all the sharing and proactive re-sharing of the RSA secret key is done modulo a prime, while the reconstruction of the RSA signature employs an observation that the secret can be recovered from such sharing using a simple equation over the integers. This equation was first observed and utilized by Luo and Lu in a design of a simple and efficient proactive RSA scheme [31] which was not proven secure and which, alas, turned out to be completely insecure [29] due to the fact that the aforementioned equation leaks some partial information about the shared secret. Interestingly, this partial information leakage can be proven harmless once the polynomial sharing used by [31] is replaced by top-level additive sharing with second-level polynomial sharing for back-up. \n \nApart of conceptual simplicity and of new techniques of independent interests, efficiency-wise the new scheme gives a factor of 2 improvement in speed and share size in the general case, and almost a factor of 4 improvement for the common RSA public exponents 3, 17, or 65537, over the scheme of [36] as analyzed in [63]. However, we also present an improved security analysis and a generalization of the [36] scheme, which shows that this scheme remains secure for smaller share sizes, leading to the same factor of 2 or 4 improvements for that scheme as well.",

For real-world security applications assuming strong adversary models, a number of practical issues still need to be addressed. In this work we thus present an instance of ring-LWE encryption that is protected against active attacks (i.e., adaptive chosen-ciphertext attacks) and equipped with countermeasures against side-channel analysis. Our solution is based on a postquantum variant of the Fujisaki-Okamoto (FO) transform combined with provably secure first-order masking. To protect the key and message during decryption, we developed a masked binomial sampler that secures the re-encryption process required by FO. Our work shows that CCA2-secured RLWE-based encryption can be achieved with reasonable performance on constrained devices but also stresses that the required transformation and handling of decryption errors implies a performance overhead that has been overlooked by the community so far. With parameters providing 233 bits of quantum security, our implementation requires 4,176,684 cycles for encryption and 25,640,380 cycles for decryption with masking and hiding countermeasures on a Cortex-M4F. The first-order security of our masked implementation is also practically verified using the non-specific t-test evaluation methodology.",

In this paper, we propose secure double auction protocols, which achieve full privacy protection of participants. That is, each bid/ask information is always kept secret, even when there is any collusion of participants. It is clear that our suggestion is stronger than other previous work in which assumptions that certain auctioneers never collude are made. To achieve full privacy protection, we employ homomorphic ElGamal encryption and distribute the private key among the all participants. In such a way, all participants jointly compute the outcome of the double auction without revealing any additional bid/ask information.

Cryptographers frequently use them as building blocks in complex protocols since they offer quite useful soundness features, which exclude cheating players. In most of modern telecommunication services, the execution of these protocols involves a prover on a portable device, with limited capacities, and namely distinct trusted part and more powerful part. The former thus has to delegate some computations to the latter. However, since the latter is not fully trusted, it should not learn any secret information. \n \nThis paper focuses on proofs of knowledge of discrete logarithm relations sets DLRS, and the delegation of some prover's computations, without leaking any critical information to the delegatee. We will achieve various efficient improvements ensuring perfect zero-knowledge against the verifier and partial zero-knowledge, but still reasonable in many contexts, against the delegatee.",

This challenge is exacerbated by the increasing heterogeneity of modern supercomputers in which nodes often contain multiple processors and coprocessors operating at different speeds, and with differing core and thread counts. We present Dtree, a dynamic task scheduler designed to address this challenge. Dtree shows close to optimal results for a class of HPC applications, improving time-to-solution by achieving near-perfect load balance while consuming negligible resources. We demonstrate Dtree’s effectiveness on up to 77,824 heterogeneous cores of the TACC Stampede supercomputer with two different petascale HPC applications: ParaBLe, which performs large-scale Bayesian network structure learning, and GTFock, which implements Fock matrix construction, an essential and expensive step in quantum chemistry codes. For ParaBLe, we show improved performance while eliminating the complexity of managing heterogeneity. For GTFock, we match the most recently published performance without using any application-specific optimizations for data access patterns (such as the task distribution design for communication reduction) that enabled that performance. We also show that Dtree can distribute from tens of thousands to hundreds of millions of irregular tasks across up to 1024 nodes with minimal overhead, while balancing load to within 2 % of optimal.",

In addition, the trusted third party (TTP) can reduce its burden because the users’ secret keys can be generated in a distributed mechanism by users’ supervisors. HIBBE enables encrypting a message for any arbitrary set of receivers, and only the chosen users and their supervisors are able to decrypt. To preserving the anonymity of the intended receivers, in this paper, for the first time, we propose an anonymous HIBBE scheme. The proposed scheme is constructed based on composite order bilinear maps. We formally define the anonymity against chosen identity vector set and chosen plaintext aack (Anon-CIVS-CPA), and prove that the proposed scheme provides this property. Performance evaluation shows the practical and deployable aspects of our proposed scheme. With the advantage of HIBBE, we enable hierarchical identity-based signature (HIBS) schemes to sign a message for a set of designated verifiers. This resulted in proposing a generic construction for the novel notion of hierarchical identity-based multi-designated verifiable signature (HIB-MDVS). We formally define HIB-MDVS’s security against existential forgery under chosen message aack (EF-CMA), prove that the resulting HIB-MDVS is unforgeable, and finally show that it provides the anonymity of the intended verifiers.",

OT is impossible to implement from scratch in an unconditionally secure way, but there are many reductions of OT to other variants of OT, as well as other primitives such as noisy channels. It is important to know how efficient such unconditionally secure reductions can be in principle, i.e., how many instances of a given primitive are at least needed to implement OT. For perfect (error-free) implementations good lower bounds are known, e.g. the bounds by Beaver (STOC ’96) or by Dodis and Micali (EUROCRYPT ’99). But since in practice one is usually willing to tolerate a small probability of error and since these statistical reductions can be much more efficient, the known bounds have only limited application. In this work we provide lower bounds on the efficiency of 1-out-of-n OT and Rabin-OT reductions to distributed randomness in the statistical case. From these results we derive bounds on reductions to different variants of OT that generalize known bounds to the statistical case.

Previously, anonymous reputation systems have been proposed, using an anonymous e-cash scheme. However, in the e-cash-based systems, the bank grasps the accumulated reputations for all users, and the fluctuation of reputations. These are private information for users. Furthermore, the timing attack using the deposit times is possible, which makes the anonymity weak. In this paper, we propose an anonymous reputation system, where the reputations of users are secret for even the reputation manager such as the bank. Our approach is to adopt an anonymous credential certifying the accumulated reputation of a user. Initially a user registers with the reputation manager, and is issued an initial certificate. After each interaction with a rater, the user as the ratee obtains an updated certificate certifying the previous reputation summed up by the current rating. The update protocol is based on the zero-knowledge proofs, and thus the reputations are secret for the reputation manager. On the other hand, due to the certificate, the user cannot maliciously alter his reputation.",

Using some recoding algorithms for the scalar, we can reduce the number of divisor class additions during the process of computing the scalar multiplication. On the other side, the divisor doublings will stay the same for all kinds of scalar multiplication algorithms. In this paper we accelerate the divisor doublings for genus 3 HECC over binary fields by using special types of curves. Depending on the degree of h, our explicit formulae only require 1I + 11M + 11S, 1I + 13M + 13S, 1I + 20M + 12S and 1I + 26M + 11S for divisor doublings in the best case, respectively.

In addition, we discuss some cases which are not included in [GKP04]. \n \nBy constructing birational transformation of variables, we derive explicit doubling formulae for special types of equations of the curve. For each type of curve, we analyze how many field operations are needed. So far no attack on any of the all curves suggested in this paper is known, even though some cases are very special. Our results allow to choose curves from a large variety which have extremely fast doubling needing only one third the time of an addition in the best case.

This ubiquity gives chance for mobile advertising, especially location-based advertising, to develop into a very promising market. In many location-based advertising services, it is implied that service providers would obtain actual locations of users in order to serve relevant advertisements which are near users' current locations. However, this practice has raised a significant privacy concern as various private information of an user can be inferred based on her locations and trajectories. In this work, we propose PrAd, a location-based advertising model that appreciates users' location privacy; i.e. it never reveals their locations to any untrusted party. Our solution is conceptualized based on several state-of-the-art privacy preserving techniques such as data obfuscation, space encoding and private information retrieval (PIR). We especially introduce algorithmic modification to existing hardware-based PIR technique to make it more practical and thus suit real-time applications. Moreover, PrAd enables a correct billing mechanism among involved parties without revealing any individual sensitive information. Finally, we confirm the effectiveness of our proposed framework by evaluating its performance using a real world dataset.",

Examples include deterministic public-key encryption (PKE), password-based cryptography, hash function nonmalleability, key-dependent message security, and more. We formalize a stronger notion, reset indifferentiability, that enables an indifferentiabilitystyle composition theorem covering such multi-stage security notions, but then show that practical hash constructions cannot be reset indifferentiable. We discuss how these limitations also affect the universal composability framework.

With a 64-Byte block size, Tiny ORAM can finish an access in 1.4μs, over 40× faster than the prior-art implementation. Second, through novel algorithmic and engineering-level optimizations, Tiny ORAM reduces the number of symmetric encryption operations by ~3× compared to a prior work.

The bound is expressed in terms of the function's derivatives, and we use it to exhibit functions whose computation requires a great deal of interprocess communication. As a sample application, we give lower bounds on information transfer in the distributed computation of some typical matrix operations. Traditional measures of computational complexity, such as the number of primitive operations or memory cells required to compute functions, do not form an adequate framework for assessing the complexity of computations carried out in distributed networks. Even in the relatively straightforward situation of memoryless processors arranged in highly structured configurations, Gentleman [4] has demonstrated that data movement, rather than arithmetic operations, can often be the significant factor in the performance of parallel computations. And for the more general kinds of distributed processing, involving arbitrary network configurations and distributed data bases, the situation is correspondingly more complex. This paper addresses the problem of measuring computational complexity in terms of the interprocess communication required when a computation is distributed among a number of processors. More precisely, we model the distributed computation of functions which depend upon large amounts of data by assuming that the data is partitioned into disjoint subsets, and that a processor is assigned to each subset. Each processor (which we can think of as a node in a computational network) computes some values based on its own \"local\" data, and transmits these values to other processors, which are able to use them in subsequent local comutations. This \"compute locally and share information\" procedure is repeated over and over until finally some (predetermined) processor outputs the value of the desired function. In measuring the complexity of such computations we will be concerned, not with the individual local computations, but rather with the total information transfer, i.e., the total number of values which must be transmitted between processors. We derive a lower bound on the total information transfer required for computing a function in a distributed network. The bound is expressed in terms of the function's derivatives, and we use it to exhibit functions whose computation requires a great deal of interprocess communicaion. As a sample application, we give lower bounds on information transfer in the distributed computation of some typical matrix operations.",

With the advent of protocols that have proven to be successful in performing single database clustering, the focus has shifted in recent years to the question of how to extend the single database protocols to a multiple database setting. To date there have been numerous attempts to create specific multiparty k-means clustering protocols that protect the privacy of each database, but according to the standard cryptographic definitions of \"privacy-protection,\" so far all such attempts have fallen short of providing adequate privacy.\n In this paper we describe a Two-Party k-Means Clustering Protocol that guarantees privacy, and is more efficient than utilizing a general multiparty \"compiler\" to achieve the same task. In particular, a main contribution of our result is a way to compute efficiently multiple iterations of k-means clustering without revealing the intermediate values. To achieve this, we show two techniques: to perform two-party division and to sample uniformly at random from an unknown domain size; the resulting Division Protocol and Random Value Protocol are of use to any protocol that requires the secure computation of a quotient or random sampling.\n Our techniques can be realized based on the existence of any semantically secure homomorphic encryption scheme. For concreteness, we describe our protocol based on Paillier Homomorphic Encryption scheme (see [21]). We will also demonstrate that our protocol is efficient in terms of communication, remaining competitive with existing protocols (such as [13]) that fail to protect privacy.",

      "abstract": "The Dynamic Connected DC InfiniBand transport protocol has recently been introduced by Mellanox to address several shortcomings of the older Reliable Connection RC, eXtended Reliable Connection XRC, and Unreliable Datagram UD transport protocols. DC aims to support all of the features provided by RC -- such as RDMA, atomics, and hardware reliability -- while allowing processes to communicate with any remote process with just one DC queue pair QP, like UD. In this paper we present the salient features of the new DC protocol including its connection and communication models.We design new verbs-level collective benchmarks to study the behavior of the new DC transport and understand the performance / memory trade-offs it presents. We then use this knowledge to propose multiple designs for MPI over DC. We evaluate an implementation of our design in the MVAPICH2 MPI library using standard MPI benchmarks and applications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such design of an MPI library over the new DC transport. Our experimental results at the microbenchmark level show that the DC-based design in MVAPICH2 is able to deliver 42% and 43% improvement in latency for large message All-to-one exchanges over XRC and RC respectively. DC-based designs are also able to give 20% and 8% improvement for small message One-to-all exchanges over RC and XRC respectively. For the All-to-all communication pattern, DC is able to deliver performance comparable to RC/XRC while outperforming in memory consumption. At the application level, for NAMD on 620 processes, the DC-based designs in MVAPICH2 outperform designs based on RC, XRC, and UD by 22%, 10%, and 13% respectively in execution time. With DL-POLY, DC outperforms RC and XRC by 75% and 30%, respectively, in total completion time while delivering performance similar to UD.",

In this paper, we demonstrate that the defense mechanisms protecting vulnerable COM objects can be easily circumvented. Specifically, our attack exploits systemic transitive trust among COM objects and allows for the instantiation and exploitation of any of several hundred known flawed controls. After demonstrating this weakness on fully patched Windows XP, Windows Vista and Windows 7 machines, we design and implement a system-wide enforcement architecture called COMBlocker, which checks the instantiation of COM objects against a global policy. We then show that COMBlocker is an effective mitigation for such attacks while imposing minimal overhead (approximately 0.5ms per policy check). In so doing, our techniques make the exploitation of default COM objects significantly more difficult.",

      "abstract": "Ever since Adleman's seminal paper [1] there has been a flood of ideas on how one could use DNA to compute. Lipton was the first to show that DNA could be used to solve more than just a variation of the famous travelling salesman problem [12]. Since then there have been many other papers on using DNA to solve various computational problems. [3,5,4,6,7,15] At the top level all these papers are. similar: they all at tempt to use DNA computation to solve some large search problem. Since a liter of water can hold 10 2-\" bases of DNA, there is the possibility that one can outperform electronic machines. However, this is currently problematic. There are several reasons for this. First, electronic machines are very fast; moreover, they are getting faster every day. Second, there are many models of how to do DNA computations. Yet, it is unclear if any of these models wilt be practical. The problem is mainly that DNA technology is not perfect. DNA operations are not error free. Finally, there is the lack of a killer app. A killer app is an application that fits the DNA model; cannot be solved by the current or even future electronic machines; and is important. The latter is critical: to be a killer app the problem must be one for which people are willing to \"pay money\" for solutions. To date there are no viable candidates for the killer app. We propose a new way to use DNA computations. This way allows us to use DNA computations to solve important and potentially killer applications. The potential applications include: (1) DNA sequencing; (2) DNA fingerprinting; (3) DNA mutation detection or population screening; (~) Other fundamental operations on DNA. The key new idea is to use DNA computat ion to operate on unknown pieces of DNA. This is a fundamental change in the way that we use DNA computation. We call these DNA~-DNA computations: DNA to DNA computations. This idea was first proposed in [8] and called \"analog\" DNA computations there. The key idea is the following. Suppose that one has a test tube that contains multiple copies of some unknown strand X of DNA, By unknown we mean that we do not known",

As our main result, we show an oblivious-transfer (OT) protocol in which two parties each create and transfer a single, stateless token and can then run an unbounded number of OTs. We also show a more efficient protocol, based only on standard symmetric-key primitives (block ciphers and collision-resistant hash functions), that can be used if a bounded number of OTs suffice. Motivated by this result, we investigate the number of stateless tokens needed for universally composable OT. We prove that our protocol is optimal in this regard for constructions making black-box use of the tokens (in a sense we define). We also show that nonblack-box techniques can be used to obtain a construction using only a single stateless token.",

      "abstract": "The incorporation of semi-supervision in the cluster detection process has proved especially useful when one wants to get a high consistency between the data partitioning and the knowledge the user has about the data domain. In recent years, several strategies for semi-supervised clustering have been proposed. The approaches adopted by these strategies aim at guiding the process of cluster detection by using constraints: to interfere with the allocation of elements to the most appropriate cluster at each iteration of the algorithm; or to modify the objective function employed. This paper proposes a novel approach for incorporating semi-supervision in the well-known k-means algorithm. This semi-supervised clustering method employs constraint information in the definition of multiple assistant representatives for the centroids used at each iteration of k-means. A refinement process is designed to reduce the number of assistant representatives considered for each centroid without losing the clustering quality. The experimental results with eight synthetic datasets show the potential of the proposed approach for dealing with complex data structures composed by clusters of different shapes.",

Due to the huge volume and velocity of data generated daily, cloud systems are inevitably becoming the platform for data publication and subscription.

In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving data publishsubscribe service for cloud-based platforms. Specifically, we first formulate the problem of privacy-preserving data publishsubscribe service by refining its security requirements on cloudbased platforms. Then, we propose a bi-policy attribute-based encryption (BP-ABE) scheme as the underlying technique that enables the encryptor to define access policies and the decryptor to define filtering policies. Based on BP-ABE, we also propose a Privacy-preserving Data Publish-Subscribe (PDPS) scheme on cloud-based platforms, which enables the cloud server to evaluate both subscription policy and access policy in a privacy-preserving way. The security analysis and performance evaluation show that the PDPS scheme is secure in standard model and efficient in practice.",

Despite extensive research into the design and verification of secure and efficient solutions, existing OT protocols enjoy \"provable\" security only against static attacks, in which an adversary must choose in advance whom it will corrupt. \n \nThis model severely limits the applicability of OT, since it provides no verifiable security against attackers who choose their victims adaptively (anytime during or after the protocol) or may even corrupt both players (which is not a moot point in a larger network protocol). This issue arises even if the communication model provides absolutely secure channels. Recent attention has been given to accomplishing adaptive security for encryption, multiparty protocols (for n > 3 participants, with faulty minority), and zero-knowledge proofs. \n \nOur work fills the remaining gap by demonstrating the first (provably) adaptively secure protocol for OT, and consequently for fully general two-party interactive computations. Based on the intractability of discrete logarithms, or more generally on a minimally restricted type of one-way trapdoor permutation, our protocols provably withstand attacks that may compromise Alice or Bob, or both, at any time.",

This approach leads to relatively poor round complexity when protocols are compiled for a point-to-point network. \n \nWe show here a VSS protocol that is simultaneouslyoptimal in terms of both the number of rounds and the number of invocations of broadcast.

It has been shown that O(log N) bandwidth blowup might not be practical for certain applications, while schemes with O(1) communication blowup incur even more delay due to costly homomorphic operations.\n In this paper, we propose a new distributed ORAM scheme referred to as Shamir Secret Sharing ORAM (S3ORAM), which achieves O(1) client-server bandwidth blowup and O(1) blocks of client storage without relying on costly partial homomorphic encryptions. S3ORAM harnesses Shamir Secret Sharing, tree-based ORAM structure and a secure multi-party multiplication protocol to eliminate costly homomorphic operations and, therefore, achieves O(1) client-server bandwidth blowup with a high computational efficiency. We conducted comprehensive experiments to assess the performance of S3ORAM and its counterparts on actual cloud environments, and showed that S3ORAM achieves three orders of magnitude lower end-to-end delay compared to alternatives with O(1) client communication blowup (Onion-ORAM), while it is one order of magnitude faster than Path-ORAM for a network with a moderate bandwidth quality.

Our protocol communicates O(n5κ) bits per multiplication and involves a negligible error probability of 2−O(κ), where κ is the error parameter. As far as our knowledge is concerned, the only known AMPC protocol with n = 3t+1 providing information theoretic security with negligible error probability is due to [9], which communicates Ω(nκ) bits and A-Casts Ω(nκ log(n)) bits per multiplication. Here A-Cast is an asynchronous broadcast primitive, which allows a party to send the same information to all other parties identically. Thus our AMPC protocol shows significant improvement in communication complexity over the AMPC protocol of [9]. As a tool for our AMPC protocol, we introduce a new asynchronous primitive called Asynchronous Complete Verifiable Secret Sharing (ACVSS), which is first of its kind and is of independent interest.

      "abstract": "BackgroundOne of the tasks in the iDASH Secure Genome Analysis Competition in 2016 was to demonstrate the feasibility of privacy-preserving queries on homomorphically encrypted genomic data. More precisely, given a list of up to 100,000 mutations, the task was to encrypt the data using homomorphic encryption in a way that allows it to be stored securely in the cloud, and enables the data owner to query the dataset for the presence of specific mutations, without revealing any information about the dataset or the queries to the cloud.MethodsWe devise a novel string matching protocol to enable privacy-preserving queries on homomorphically encrypted data. Our protocol combines state-of-the-art techniques from homomorphic encryption and private set intersection protocols to minimize the computational and communication cost.ResultsWe implemented our protocol using the homomorphic encryption library SEAL v2.1, and applied it to obtain an efficient solution to the iDASH competition task. For example, using 8 threads, our protocol achieves a running time of only 4 s, and a communication cost of 2 MB, when querying for the presence of 5 mutations from an encrypted dataset of 100,000 mutations.ConclusionsWe demonstrate that homomorphic encryption can be used to enable an efficient privacy-preserving mechanism for querying the presence of particular mutations in realistic size datasets. Beyond its applications to genomics, our protocol can just as well be applied to any kind of data, and is therefore of independent interest to the homomorphic encryption community.",

      "abstract": "When a group of individuals and organizations wish to compute a stable matching---for example, when medical students are matched to medical residency programs---they often outsource the computation to a trusted arbiter in order to preserve the privacy of participants' preferences. Secure multi-party computation offers the possibility of private matching processes that do not rely on any common trusted third party. However, stable matching algorithms have previously been considered infeasible for execution in a secure multi-party context on non-trivial inputs because they are computationally intensive and involve complex data-dependent memory access patterns.\n We adapt the classic Gale-Shapley algorithm for use in such a context, and show experimentally that our modifications yield a lower asymptotic complexity and more than an order of magnitude in practical cost improvement over previous techniques. Our main improvements stem from designing new oblivious data structures that exploit the properties of the matching algorithms. We apply a similar strategy to scale the Roth-Peranson instability chaining algorithm, currently in use by the National Resident Matching Program. The resulting protocol is efficient enough to be useful at the scale required for matching medical residents nationwide, taking just over 18 hours to complete an execution simulating the 2016 national resident match with more than 35,000 participants and 30,000 residency slots.",

In this model, we show a 1-round statistically sound protocol for any log-space uniform $\\mathcal{NC}\\,$ circuit. In contrast, in the single server setting all known one-round succinct delegation protocols are computationally sound. The protocol extends the arithemetization techniques of [Goldwasser-Kalai-Rothblum, STOC 08] and [Feige-Kilian, STOC 97]. \n \nNext we consider a simplified view of the protocol of [Goldwasser-Kalai-Rothblum, STOC 08] in the single-server model with a non-succinct, but public, offline stage. Using this simplification we construct two computationally sound protocols for delegation of computation of any circuit C with depth d and input length n, even a non-uniform one, such that the client runs in time n·poly(log(|C|), d). The first protocol is potentially practical and easier to implement for general computations than the full protocol of [Goldwasser-Kalai-Rothblum, STOC 08], and the second is a 1-round protocol with similar complexity, but less efficient server.",

      "abstract": "Secure outsourcing of computation to cloud servers has attracted much attention in recent years. In a typical outsourcing scenario, the client stores its data on a cloud server and later asks the server to perform computations on the stored data. The verifiable computation (VC) of Gennaro, Gentry, Parno (Crypto 2010) and the homomorphic MAC (HomMAC) of Backes, Fiore, Reischuk (CCS 2013) allow the client to verify the server’s computation with substantially less computational cost than performing the outsourced computation. The existing VC and HomMAC schemes that can be considered practical (do not required heavy computations such as computing fully homomorphic encryptions), are limited to compute linear and quadratic polynomials on the outsourced data. In this paper, we introduce a batch verifiable computation (BVC) model that can be used when the computation of the same function on multiple datasets is required, and construct two schemes for computing polynomials of high degree on the outsourced data. Our schemes allow efficient client verification, efficient server computation, and composition of computation results. Both schemes allow new elements to be added to each outsourced dataset. The second scheme also allows new datasets to be added. A unique feature of our schemes is that the storage required at the server for storing the authentication information, stays the same as the number of outsourced datasets is increased, and so the server storage overhead (the ratio of the server storage to the total size of the datasets) approaches 1. In all existing schemes this ratio is \\(\\ge 2\\). Hence, our BVC can effectively halve the required server storage.",

In a recent work (Latincrypt ‘15), Chou and Orlandi (CO) present the most efficient, fully UC-secure OT protocol to date and argue its security under the CDH assumption. Unfortunately, a subsequent work by Genc et al. (Eprint ‘17) exposes a flaw in their proof which renders the CO protocol insecure. In this work, we make the following contributions: We first point out two additional, previously undiscovered flaws in the CO protocol and then show how to patch the proof with respect to static and malicious corruptions in the UC model under the stronger Gap Diffie-Hellman (GDH) assumption. With the proof failing for adaptive corruptions even under the GDH assumption, we then present a novel OT protocol which builds on ideas from the CO protocol and can be proven fully UC-secure under the CDH assumption. Interestingly, our new protocol is actually significantly more efficient (roughly by a factor of two) than the CO protocol. This improvement is made possible by avoiding costly redundancy in the symmetric encryption scheme used in the CO protocol. Our ideas can also be applied to the original CO protocol, which yields a similar gain",

      "abstract": "We introduce and study the notion of non-interactive secure multiparty computation (NIMPC). An NIMPC protocol for a function f(x1,…,x n ) is specified by a joint probability distribution R = (R1,…,R n ) and local encoding functions Enc i (x i ,r i ), 1 ≤ i ≤ n. Given correlated randomness (r1,…,r n ) ∈ R R, each party P i , using its input x i and its randomness r i , computes the message m i = Enc i (x i ,r i ). The messages m1,…,m n can be used to decode f(x1,…,x n ). For a set T ⊆ [n], the protocol is said to be T-robust if revealing the messages \\((\\mathrm{Enc}_i(x_i,r_i))_{i\\not\\in T}\\) together with the randomness (r i )i ∈ T gives the same information about \\((x_i)_{i\\not\\in T}\\) as an oracle access to the function f restricted to these input values. Namely, a coalition T can learn no more than the restriction of f fixing the inputs of uncorrupted parties, which, in this non-interactive setting, one cannot hope to hide. For 0 ≤ t ≤ n, the protocol is t-robust if it is T-robust for every T of size at most t and it is fully robust if it is n-robust. A 0-robust NIMPC protocol for f coincides with a protocol in the private simultaneous messages model of Feige et al. (STOC 1994).",

Similar to secret-sharing schemes for general access structures, there are gaps between the known lower bounds and upper bounds on the share size for graphs. Motivated by the question of what makes a graph “hard” for secret-sharing schemes (that is, they require large shares), we study very dense graphs, that is, graphs whose complement contains few edges. We show that if a graph with $$n$$n vertices contains $$\\left( {\\begin{array}{c}n\\\\ 2\\end{array}}\\right) -n^{1+\\beta }$$n2-n1+β edges for some constant $$0 \\le \\beta <1$$0≤β<1, then there is a scheme realizing the graph with total share size of $$\\tilde{O}(n^{5/4+3\\beta /4})$$O~(n5/4+3β/4). This should be compared to $$O(n^2/\\log (n))$$O(n2/log(n)), the best upper bound known for the total share size in general graphs. Thus, if a graph is “hard,” then the graph and its complement should have many edges. We generalize these results to nearly complete $$k$$k-homogeneous access structures for a constant $$k$$k. To complement our results, we prove lower bounds on the total share size for secret-sharing schemes realizing very dense graphs, e.g., for linear secret-sharing schemes, we prove a lower bound of $$\\Omega (n^{1+\\beta /2})$$Ω(n1+β/2) for a graph with $$\\left( {\\begin{array}{c}n\\\\ 2\\end{array}}\\right) -n^{1+\\beta }$$n2-n1+β edges.",

This paper explores an alternative approach where users only disclose an aggregate model --- the \"gist\" --- of their data. We aim to preserve data utility and simultaneously provide user privacy. We show that this approach can be efficiently supported by letting users contribute encrypted and differentially-private data to an aggregator. The aggregator combines encrypted contributions and can only extract an aggregate model of the underlying data. We evaluate our framework on a dataset of 100,000 U.S. users obtained from the U.S. Census Bureau and show that i it provides accurate aggregates with as little as 100 users, ii it can generate revenue for both users and data brokers, and iii its overhead is appreciably low.",

      "abstract": "Recent techniques reduce ORAM communication complexity down to constant in the number of blocks N . However, they induce expensive homomorphic encryption on both the server and the client. In this paper, we present an alternative approach CH -ORAM. This ORAM features constant communication complexity without homomorphic encryption, in exchange for expanding the traditional ORAM setting from single-server to multiple non-colluding servers. We show that adding as few as 4 servers allows for substantially reduced client and server computation compared to existing singleserver alternatives. Our approach uses techniques from informationtheoretically secure Private Information Retrieval to replace homomorphic encryption with simple XOR operations. Besides O(1) communication complexity, our construction also features O(1) client memory and a block size of only Ω(logN). This leads to an ORAM which is extremely lightweight and suitable for deployment even on memory and compute constrained devices. Finally, CH ORAM features a circuit size which is constant in the blocksize making it especially attractive for secure RAM computations.",

In secret sharing schemes, every participant is given a unique share. When the desired group of participants come together and provide their shares, the secret is obtained. For other combinations of shares, a garbage value is returned. A threshold secret sharing scheme was proposed by Shamir and Blakeley independently. In this (n,t) threshold secret sharing scheme, the secret can be obtained when at least t out of n participants contribute their shares. This paper proposes a novel algorithm to reveal the secret only to the subsets of participants belonging to the access structure. This scheme implements totally generalized ideal secret sharing. Unlike threshold secret sharing schemes, this scheme reveals the secret only to the authorized sets of participants, not any arbitrary set of users with cardinality more than or equal to t. Since any access structure can be realized with this scheme, this scheme can be exploited to implement various access priorities and access control mechanisms. A major advantage of this scheme over the existing ones is that the shares being distributed to the participants is totally independent of the secret being shared. Hence, no restrictions are imposed on the scheme and it finds a wider use in real world applications.",

      "abstract": "Even as data and analytics-driven applications are becoming increasingly popular, retrieving data from shared databases poses a threat to the privacy of their users. For example, investors/patients retrieve records about stocks/diseases they are interested in from a stock/medical database. Knowledge of such interest is sensitive information that the database server would have access to, unless some mitigating measures are deployed. Private information retrieval (PIR) is a promising security primitive to protect the privacy of users’ interests. PIR allows the retrieval of a data record from a database without letting the database server know which record is being retrieved. The privacy guarantees could either be information theoretic or computational. Alternatively, anonymizers, which hide the identities of data users, may be used to protect the privacy of users’ interests for some situations. In this paper, we study rPIR, a new family of information-theoretic PIR schemes using ramp secret sharing. We have designed four rPIR schemes, using three ramp secret sharing approaches, achieving answer communication costs close to the cost of non-private information retrieval. Evaluation shows that, for many practical settings, rPIR schemes can achieve lower communication costs and the same level of privacy compared with traditional information-theoretic PIR schemes and anonymizers. Efficacy of the proposed schemes is demonstrated for two very different scenarios (outsourced data sharing and P2P content delivery) with realistic analysis and experiments. In many situations of these two scenarios, rPIR’s advantage of low communication cost outweighs its disadvantages, which results in less expenditure and/or better quality of service compared with what may be achieved if traditional information-theoretic PIR and anonymizers are used.",

In this paper we introduce the concept of an aggregate signature, present security models for such signatures, and give several applications for aggregate signatures. We construct an efficient aggregate signature from a recent short signature scheme based on bilinear maps due to Boneh, Lynn, and Shacham. Aggregate signatures are useful for reducing the size of certificate chains (by aggregating all signatures in the chain) and for reducing message size in secure routing protocols such as SBGP. We also show that aggregate signatures give rise to verifiably encrypted signatures. Such signatures enable the verifier to test that a given ciphertext C is the encryption of a signature on a given message M. Verifiably encrypted signatures are used in contract-signing protocols. Finally, we show that similar ideas can be used to extend the short signature scheme to give simple ring signatures.",

      "abstract": "Lightweight Bitcoin clients are gaining increasing adoption among Bitcoin users, owing to their reduced resource and bandwidth consumption. These clients support a simplified payment verification (SPV) mode as they are only required to download and verify a part of the block chain---thus supporting the usage of Bitcoin on constrained devices, such as smartphones. SPV clients rely on Bloom filters to receive transactions that are relevant to their local wallet. These filters embed all the Bitcoin addresses used by the SPV clients, and are outsourced to more powerful Bitcoin nodes which then only forward to those clients transactions relevant to their outsourced Bloom filters.\n In this paper, we explore the privacy of existing SPV clients. We show analytically and empirically that the reliance on Bloom filters within existing SPV clients leaks considerable information about the addresses of Bitcoin users. Our results show that an SPV client who uses a modest number of Bitcoin addresses (e.g., < 20) risks revealing almost all of his addresses. We also show that this information leakage is further exacerbated when users restart their SPV clients and/or when the adversary has access to more than one Bloom filter pertaining to the same SPV client. Motivated by these findings, we propose an efficient countermeasure to enhance the privacy of users which rely on SPV clients; our proposal can be directly integrated within existing SPV client implementations.",

      "abstract": "Secure protocols for complicated tasks are usually constructed in two phases. Initially, one designs a protocol that is secure in a semihonest model. Second, zero-knowledge correctness proofs are added to assure correctness and privacy against malicious adversaries. Often the corresponding communication and computational overhead makes this approach intractable in practice. Therefore, we define an intermediate notion of security—consistency. In a consistent protocol, participants always learn if their opponent cheats but cannot complain without violating their own privacy. Thus, a potential victim has to choose between the utility of the correct output and a potential privacy breach. In many contexts, where the long-term reputation of a service provider is more important than the privacy of an individual query, such security notion provides adequate protection with a minimal overhead. Private inference control and adaptive oblivious transfer are the most straightforward examples of such protocols.",

Two related notions of authentication are: Deniable Authentication (see Dwork, Naor and Sahai [25]) and Ring Signatures (see Rivest, Shamir and Tauman [38]). In this paper we show how to combine these notions and achieve Deniable Ring Authentication: it is possible to convince a verifier that a member of an ad hoc subset of participants (a ring) is authenticating a message m without revealing which one (source hiding), and the verifier V cannot convince a third party that message m was indeed authenticated - there is no 'paper trail' of the conversation, other than what could be produced by V alone, as in zero-knowledge.We provide an efficient protocol for deniable ring authentication based on any strong encryption scheme. That is once an entity has published a public-key of such an encryption system, it can be drafted to any such ring. There is no need for any other cryptographic primitive. The scheme can be extended to yield threshold authentication (e.g. at least k members of the ring are approving the message) as well.",

We consider the scenario where three players have access to random variables X, Y, and Z, respectively, and give the exact condition on the joint distribution P XYZ under which unconditional broadcast is possible. More precisely, we show that this condition characterizes the possibility of realizing so-called pseudo-signatures between the players.

In this paper we propose three types of protocol as variants of the Naor-Pinkas-Sumner protocol in each different framework.

The second protocol furthermore eliminates an oblivious transfer from the two-party operation in their protocol and the first protocol by adding a new entity named \"mediator\" into the Yao's two-party setting. In the new three-party setting, it is assumed that no party colludes with any other parties to retain the secrecy of the clients' data. The last protocol removes the mediator from the second protocol in return for clients' some additional burden.

Our method requires only one homomorphic multiplication for each of iterations and so the total computation cost grows linearly with the depth of the decryption circuit. We also show how to recrypt packed ciphertexts on the RLWE construction with an open-source implementation.

Unlike the deniable ring authentication proposed [19], we require this primitive to be non-interactive. Having this restriction, the primitive can be used in practice without having to use the anonymous routing channel (eg. MIX-nets) introduced [19]. In this paper, we provide the formal definition of non-interactive deniable ring authentication schemes together with a generic construction of such schemes from any ring signature schemes. The generic construction can be used to convert any existing ring signature schemes for example [20, 1], to non-interactive deniable ring authentication schemes. We also present an extension of this idea to allow a non-interactive deniable ring to threshold ring authentication. In this scenario, the signature can convince a group of verifiers, but the verifiers cannot convince any other third party about this fact, because any collusion of t verifiers can always generate a valid message-signature pair. We also present a generic construction of this scheme. A special case of this scenario is a deniable ring-to-ring authentication scheme, where the collaboration of all verifiers is required to generate a valid message-signature pair.",

An HSS scheme supports a local evaluation of functions on shares of one or more secret inputs, such that the resulting shares of the output are short. Some applications require the stronger notion of additive HSS, where the shares of the output add up to the output over some finite Abelian group. While some strong positive results for HSS are known under specific cryptographic assumptions, many natural questions remain open. \n \nWe initiate a systematic study of HSS, making the following contributions. \n \n - A definitional framework. We present a general framework for defining HSS schemes that unifies and extends several previous notions from the literature, and cast known results within this framework. \n - Limitations. We establish limitations on information-theoretic multi-input HSS with short output shares via a relation with communication complexity. We also show that additive HSS for non-trivial functions, even the AND of two input bits, implies non-interactive key exchange, and is therefore unlikely to be implied by public-key encryption or even oblivious transfer. \n - Applications. We present two types of applications of HSS. First, we construct 2-round protocols for secure multiparty computation from a simple constant-size instance of HSS. As a corollary, we obtain 2-round protocols with attractive asymptotic efficiency features under the Decision Diffie Hellman (DDH) assumption. Second, we use HSS to obtain nearly optimal worst-case to average-case reductions in P. This in turn has applications to fine-grained average-case hardness and verifiable computation.",

Existing encryption techniques (e.g., SQL-aware encryption) can mitigate privacy concerns, but they still leak information through access patterns which are vulnerable to statistical inference attacks. Oblivious Random Access Machine (ORAM) can seal such leakages, but the recent studies showed significant challenges on the integration of ORAM into databases. Specifically, the direct usage of ORAM on databases is not only costly but also permits very limited query functionalities. We propose new oblivious data structures called Oblivious Matrix Structure (OMAT) and Oblivious Tree Structure (OTREE), which allow tree-based ORAM to be integrated into database systems in a more efficient manner with diverse query functionalities supported. OMAT provides special ORAM packaging strategies for table structures, which not only offers a significantly better performance but also enables a broad range of query types that may not be practical in existing frameworks. OTREE allows oblivious conditional queries to be deployed on tree-indexed databases more efficient than existing techniques.

In this paper, we are interested in protocols that prove physical properties of physical objects without revealing further information. The literature lacks a unified formal framework for designing and analyzing such protocols. We suggest the first paradigm for formally defining, modeling, and analyzing physical zero-knowledge (PhysicalZK) protocols, using the Universal Composability framework.

However, all proposed schemes are quite inefficient and homomorphic evaluation of ciphertexts usually takes several seconds on high-end CPUs, even for evaluating simple functions. In this work we investigate the potential of FPGAs for speeding up those evaluation operations. We propose an architecture to accelerate schemes based on the ring learning with errors (RLWE) problem and specifically implemented the somewhat homomorphic encryption scheme YASHE, which was proposed by Bos, Lauter, Loftus, and Naehrig in 2013. Due to the large size of ciphertexts and evaluation keys, on-chip storage of all data is not possible and external memory is required. For efficient utilization of the external memory we propose an efficient double-buffered memory access scheme and a polynomial multiplier based on the number theoretic transform (NTT). For the parameter set (n = 16384, dlog2 qe = 512) capable of evaluating 9 levels of multiplications, we can perform a homomorphic addition in 0.94ms and a homomorphic multiplication in 48.67ms.",

It is also an indispensable building block in various cryptographic protocols. In the literature, most of these existing protocols are employing Shamir’s secret sharing, while Blakley’s one has attracted very little attention. In this paper, we revisit Blakley’s secret sharing that is based on hyperplane geometry, and illustrate that some of its potentials are yet to be employed. In particular, it has an appealing property that compared with Shamir’s secret sharing, it not only handles (t, n) secret sharing with similar computational costs, but also handles (n, n) secret sharing with better efficiency. We further apply this property to design a provably secure and optimal resilient proactive secret sharing scheme. Our proposed protocol is versatile to support proactive cryptosystems based on various assumptions, and it employs only one type of verifiable secret sharing as the building block. By contrast, the existing proactive secret sharing schemes with similar properties all employ two different types of verifiable secret sharing. Finally, we briefly discuss some possible extensions of our proposed protocol as well as how to explore more potentials of Blakley’s secret sharing.",

      "abstract": "The number of communication rounds is a classic complexity measure for protocols; reducing round complexity is a major goal in protocol design. However, when the communication time is inconstant, and in particular, when one of the parties intentionally delays its messages, the round complexity measure may become meaningless. For example, if one of the rounds takes longer than the rest of the protocol, then it does not matter if the round complexity is bounded by a constant or by a polynomial. In this paper, we propose a complexity measure called responsive round complexity. Loosely speaking, a protocol has responsive round complexity m with respect to Party A, if it makes the following guarantee. If A's longest delay in responding to a message in a run of the protocol is t, then, in that run, the overall communication time is at most mċ t. The logic behind this definition is that if a party responds quickly to a message, whether it has a good connection or it just chooses not to delay its messages, then this party deserves to get an overall quicker running time. Responsive round complexity is particularly interesting in a setting where a party may gain something by delaying its messages. In this case, the delaying party does not deserve the same response time as another party that behaves nicely. \n \nWe demonstrate the significance of responsive round complexity by presenting a new protocol for concurrent zero-knowledge. The new protocol is a black-box concurrent zero knowledge proof for all languages in NP with round complexity O(log2 n) but responsive round complexity O(log n). While the round complexity of the new protocol is similar to what is known from previous works, its responsive round complexity is a significant improvement: all known concurrent zero-knowledge protocols require O(log2 n) rounds. Furthermore, in light of the known lower bounds, the responsive round complexity of this protocol is basically optimal.",

Moreover, our schemes can tolerate any number of (malicious) verification queries. Our first construction relies on the sole assumption that one way functions exist, allows for arbitrary composition (i.e., outputs of previously authenticated computations can be used as inputs for new ones) but has the drawback that the size of the produced tags grows with the degree of the circuit.

This powerful concept has applications, for example, to e-voting and data retention compliance, where data structure histories should be private. The concept of weak history-independence (WHI) assumes only a single observation will ever occur, while strong history-independence (SHI) allows for multiple observations at arbitrary times. WHI constructions tend to be fast, but provide no repeatability, while SHI constructions provide unlimited repeatability, but tend to be slow. We introduce auditable data structures, where an auditor can observe data structures at arbitrary times (as in SHI), but we relax the unrealistic restriction that data structures cannot react to observations, since in most applications of history-independence, data owners know when observations have occurred. We consider two audit scenarios—secure topology, where an auditor can observe the contents and pointers of a data structure, and secure implementation, where an auditor can observe the memory layout of a data structure. We present a generic template for auditable data structures and, as a foundation for any auditable data structure, an Auditable Memory Manager (AMM), which is an efficient memory manager that translates any auditable data structure with a secure topology into one with a secure implementation. We give a prototype implementation that provides empirical evidence that the worst-case time running times of our AMM are 45 to 8,300 faster than those of a well-known SHI memory manager. Thus, auditable data structures provide a practical way of achieving time efficiency, as in WHI, while allowing for multiple audits, as in SHI.",

A few notable examples of such primitives include items like single database Private Information Retrieval (PIR) schemes (introduced in [15]) and private database update with small communication (introduced in [5]). In this paper, we illustrate a general methodology for determining what types of protocols can and cannot be implemented with small communication by using homomorphic encryption in a black-box way. \n \nWe hope that this work will provide a simple \"litmus test\" of feasibility for black-box use of known homomorphic encryption schemes by other cryptographic researchers attempting to develop new protocols with low communication. Additionally, a precise mathematical language for reasoning about such problems is developed in this work, which may be of independent interest. We stress that the class of algebraic structures for which we prove communication complexity lower bounds is large, and covers practically all known semantically-secure homomorphic cryptosystems (including those based upon bilinear maps). \n \nFinally, we show the following equivalence which relates group homomorphic encryption and a major open question of designing a so-called fully-homomorphic cryptosystem: a fully homomorphic encryption scheme (over a non-zero ring) exists if and only if there exists homomorphic encryption over any finite non-abelian simple group. This result somewhat generalizes results of Barrington [1] (to any group containing a finite non-abelian simple subgroup) and of Maurer and Rhodes [18], and in fact gives a constructiveproof of the 1974 result Werner [28].

      "abstract": "Functional encryption lies at the frontiers of the current research in cryptography; some variants have been shown sufficiently powerful to yield indistinguishability obfuscation (IO), while other variants have been constructed from standard assumptions such as LWE. Indeed, most variants have been classified as belonging to either the former or the latter category. However, one mystery that has remained is the case of secret-key functional encryption with an unbounded number of keys and ciphertexts. On the one hand, this primitive is not known to imply anything outside of minicrypt, the land of secret-key cryptography, but, on the other hand, we do no know how to construct it without the heavy hammers in obfustopia. In this work, we show that (subexponentially secure) secret-key functional encryption is powerful enough to construct indistinguishability obfuscation if we additionally assume the existence of (subexponentially secure) plain public-key encryption. In other words, secret-key functional encryption provides a bridge from cryptomania to obfustopia. On the technical side, our result relies on two main components. As our first contribution, we show how to use secret-key functional encryption to get “exponentially efficient indistinguishability obfuscation” (XIO), a notion recently introduced by Lin et al. (PKC’16) as a relaxation of IO. Lin et al. show how to use XIO and the LWE assumption to build IO. As our second contribution, we improve on this result by replacing its reliance on the LWE assumption with any plain public-key encryption scheme. Lastly, we ask whether secret-key functional encryption can be used to construct public-key encryption itself and therefore take us all the way from minicrypt to obfustopia. A result of Asharov and Segev (FOCS’15) shows that this is not the case under black-box constructions, even for exponentially secure functional encryption. We show, through a non-black-box construction, that subexponentially secure-key functional encryption indeed leads to public-key encryption. The resulting public-key encryption scheme, however, is at most quasi-polynomially secure, which is insufficient to take us to obfustopia.",

This improves the previous bound of 3t < n on the tolerable number of faults [BG W88, CCD88]. We demonstrate a resilient method to multiply secretly shared values without using unproven cryptographic assumptions. The crux of our method is a new, non-cryptographic zero-knowledge technique which extends verifiable secret sharing to allow proofs based on secretly shared values. Under this method, a single party can secretly share values v1,...vm along with another secret w = P(v1,...,vm), where P is any polynomial size circuit; and she can prove to all other parties that w = P(v1,..., vm), without revealing w or any other information. Our protocols allow an exponentially small chance of error, but are provably optimal in their resilience against Byzantine faults. Furthermore, our solutions use operations over exponentially large fields, greatly reducing the amount of interaction necessary for computing natural functions.",

A rich body of work deals with the study of completeness for secure two-party computation. A function f is complete for SFE if a protocol for securely evaluating f allows the secure evaluation of all (efficiently computable) functions. The questions investigated are which functions are complete for SFE, which functions have SFE protocols unconditionally and whether there are functions that are neither complete nor have efficient SFE protocols.The previous study of these questions was mainly conducted from an Information Theoretic point of view and provided strong answers in the form of combinatorial properties. However, we show that there are major differences between the information theoretic and computational settings. In particular, we show functions that are considered as having SFE unconditionally by the combinatorial criteria but are actually complete in the computational setting. We initiate the fully computational study of these fundamental questions. Somewhat surprisingly, we manage to provide an almost full characterization of the complete functions in this model as well. More precisely, we present a computational criterion (called computational row non-transitivity) for a function f to be complete for the asymmetric case. Furthermore, we show a matching criterion called computational row transitivity for f to have a simple SFE (based on no additional assumptions). This criterion is close to the negation of the computational row non-transitivity and thus we essentially characterize all \"nice\" functions as either complete or having SFE unconditionally.",

Two practical generic constructions for PKENO have been proposed so far, starting from either identity-based encryption or public-key encryption with witness-recovering decryption (PKEWR). We show that the known transformation from PKEWR to PKENO fails to provide chosen-ciphertext security; only the transformation from identity-based encryption remains thus valid. Next, we prove that PKENO can alternatively be built out of robust non-interactive threshold public-key cryptosystems, a primitive that differs from identity-based encryption. Using the new transformation, we construct two efficient PKENO schemes: one based on the Decisional Diffie-Hellman assumption (in the Random-Oracle Model) and one based on the Decisional Linear assumption (in the standard model). Last but not least, we propose new applications of PKENO in protocol design. Motivated by these applications, we reconsider proof soundness for PKENO and put forward new definitions that are stronger than those considered so far. We give a taxonomy of all definitions and demonstrate them to be satisfiable.",

The protocol uses n(t+1)/2 random bits. We show that this is the optimal randomness complexity in the case each random bit is shared between two players (low-contention protocols).

In the semi-honest case, our protocol relies on the “ring learning with errors” (RLWE) assumption, whereas in the malicious case, security is shown under the Ring LWE assumption as well as the existence of simulation-extractable NIZK proof systems and succinct non-interactive arguments. In the malicious setting, we also relax the communication and computation requirements above, and only require that they be “small” ‐ polylogarithmic in the computation size and linear in the size of the joint size of the inputs. Our constructions leverage the key homomorphic property of the recent fully homomorphic encryption scheme of Brakerski and Vaikuntanathan (CRYPTO 2011, FOCS 2011).

Levin (Probl Inf Transm 39(1):92–103, 2003) has conjectured that the unitary transformation $$g(a,x)=(a,f(x)+ax)$$g(a,x)=(a,f(x)+ax), where f is any length-preserving function and $$a,x \\in \\hbox {GF}_{{2}^{\\Vert x\\Vert }}$$a,x∈GF2‖x‖, is an information-theoretically secure operator within a polynomial factor. Here, we show that Levin’s one-way permutation is provably secure because its output values are four maximally entangled two-qubit states, and whose probability of factoring them approaches zero faster than the multiplicative inverse of any positive polynomial poly(x) over the Boolean ring of all subsets of x. Our results demonstrate through well-known theorems that existence of classical one-way functions implies existence of a universal quantum one-way permutation that cannot be inverted in subexponential time in the worst case.",

      "abstract": "We present a general framework for constructing non-interactive universally composable (UC) commitment schemes that are secure against adaptive adversaries in the non-erasure setting under a single re-usable common reference string. Previously, such “fully-equipped” UC commitment schemes are only known in [8, 9], with an unavoidable overhead of O(κ) in the sense of communication and computational complexities; meaning that to commitλ bits, the communication and computational costs require O(λκ), whereκ denotes the security parameter. Efficient construction of a fully-equipped UC commitment scheme was a long-standing open problem. We introduce a cryptographic primitive, called all-but-many encryptions (ABMEs), and prove that it is a translation of fully-equipped UC commitment in the primitive level. We then construct ABMEs from cryptographic primitives that we calla probabilistic pseudo random function family andextractable sigma protocols – the former is a probabilistic version of a pseudo random function family and the latter is a special kind of sigma (i.e., canonical 3-round public-coin HVSZK) protocols with some extractability. We provide fully-equipped UC commitment schemes from ABMEs under DDH and DCR-based assumptions, respectively. In particular, the DCR-based scheme is the first fully-equipped UC commitment scheme with optimal expansion factor Ω(1); to commitκ bits, the communication and computational costs are Ω(κ). We further construct a fully-equipped UC commitment scheme from a general assumption (in which trap-door permutations exist), which is far more e fficient than the previous construction [9], because, unlike [9], our construction does not require non-interactive zero-knowledge proof systems.",

We show that the answer to this fundamental question is negative, if one is limited black-box reductions. \n \nInstead, we ask whether one can save on secret random bits at the expense of more public random bits. Using a shorter secret input is highly desirable, not only because it saves resources, but also because it can yield tighter reductions from higher-level primitives to one-way functions. Our first main result shows that if the number of output elements of f is at most 2k, then a simple construction using pairwise-independent hash functions results in a new one-way function that uses only k secret bits. We also demonstrate that it is not the knowledge of security of f, but rather of its structure, that enables the savings: a black-box reduction cannot, for a general f, reduce the secret-input length, even given the knowledge that security of f is only 2-k; nor can a black-box reduction use fewer than k secret input bits when f has 2k distinct outputs. \n \nOur second main result is an application of the public-randomness approach: we show a construction of a pseudorandom generator based on any regular one-way function with output range of known size 2k. The construction requires a seed of only 2n + O(k log k) bits (as opposed to O(n log n) in previous constructions); the savings come from the reusability of public randomness.

      "abstract": "Code obfuscation is one of the most powerful concepts in cryptography. It could yield functional encryption, digital rights management, and maybe even secure cloud computing. However, general code obfuscation has been proven impossible and the research then focused on obfuscating very specific functions, studying weaker security definitions for obfuscation, and using tamper-proof hardware tokens to achieve general code obfuscation. Following this last line this work presents the first scheme which bases general code obfuscation of multiple programs on one single stateless hardware token. Our construction is proven secure in the UC-framework and proceeds in three steps: 1. We construct an obfuscation scheme based on fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) and a hybrid functionality conditional decrypt, which decrypts the result of a homomorphic computation given a proof that the computation was performed as intended. One difficulty of the first step are possible decryptions errors in the FHE. These decryption errors can occur whenever the randomness for the encryption is chosen maliciously by the receiver of the obfuscated code. Such decryption errors then could make a real obfuscated computation distinguishable from a black box use of the non-obfuscated program. 2. Given two common reference strings (CRS) we construct a UC-protocol realizing the functionality conditional decrypt with a stateless hardware token. As the token is stateless it is resettable by a dishonest receiver and the proofs given to the token must be resettably sound. One additional difficulty occurs when the issuer of the token can be corrupted. A malicious token can be stateful and it cannot be prevented that it aborts after a hardwired number of invocations. To prevent adaptive behavior of a malicious token the data of the receiver has to be hidden from the token and the proofs given to the token must even hide the size of the program and the length of the computation. 3. Last we construct a protocol constructing a CRS with a stateless hardware token. Care has to be taken here to not let the token learn anything about the resulting CRS which could not be simulated, because the very same token will later be used in a protocol based on the security of this CRS.",

In terms of the computational effort required to the parties, our protocol is comparable to TOR, but the network latency associated with TOR's high round complexity ends up dominating the running time. Compared to other recently proposed alternative to TOR (such as the PB-OR and CL-OR protocols) our scheme still has the advantage of being non-interactive (both PB-OR and CL-OR require some interaction to update time-sensitive information), and achieves similar computational performances. We performed extensive implementation and simulation tests that confirm our theoretical analysis. Additionally, while comparing our scheme to PB-OR, we discovered a flaw in the security of that scheme which we repair in this paper. \n \nOur solution is based on the application of forward-secure encryption.

      "abstract": "We study robust secret sharing schemes in which between one third and one half of the players are corrupted. In this scenario, robust secret sharing is possible only with a share size larger than the secrets, and allowing a positive probability of reconstructing the wrong secret. We focus on the most challenging case where the number corruptions is just one less than the number of honest players. In the standard model, it is known that at least $$m+k$$ bits per share are needed to robustly share a secret of bit-length m with an error probability of $$2^{-k}$$; however, to the best of our knowledge, no efficient scheme matches this lower bound: the one that gets closest has share size $$m+\\widetilde{O}n+k$$, where n is the number of players in the scheme. \n \nWe show that it is possible to obtain schemes with close to minimal share size in a model of local adversaries, i.e. in which corrupt players cannot communicate between receiving their respective honest shares and submitting corrupted shares to the reconstruction procedure, but may coordinate before the execution of the protocol and can also gather information afterwards. In this limited adversarial model, we prove a lower bound of roughly $$m+k$$ bits on the minimal share size, which is somewhat surprisingly similar to the lower bound in the standard model, where much stronger adversaries are allowed. We then present efficient scheme that essentially meets our lower bound, and has shorter share size than any known efficient construction in the standard model for the same set of parameters. For our construction, we introduce a novel procedure that compiles an error correcting code into a new randomized one, with the following two properties: a single local portion of a codeword leaks no information on the encoded message itself, and any set of portions of a codeword reconstructs the message with error probability exponentially low in the set size.",

In this work, we present the first generic construction of structure-preserving signature schemes whose reduction cost is independent of the number of signing queries. Its chosen-message security is almost tightly reduced to the chosen-plaintext security of a structure-preserving public-key encryption scheme and the security of Groth-Sahai proof system. Technically, we adapt the adaptive partitioning technique by Hofheinz (Eurocrypt 2017) to the setting of structure-preserving signature schemes. To achieve a structure-preserving scheme, our new variant of the adaptive partitioning technique relies only on generic group operations in the scheme itself. Interestingly, however, we will use non-generic operations during our security analysis. Instantiated over asymmetric bilinear groups, the security of our concrete scheme is reduced to the external Diffie-Hellman assumption with linear reduction cost in the security parameter, independently of the number of signing queries. The signatures in our schemes consist of a larger number of group elements than those in other non-tight schemes, but can be verified faster, assuming their security reduction loss is compensated by increasing the security parameter to the next standard level.",

      "abstract": "In a functional encryption (FE) scheme, the owner of the secret key can generate restricted decryption keys that allow users to learn specific functions of the encrypted messages and nothing else. In many known constructions of FE schemes, such a notion of security is guaranteed only for messages that are fixed ahead of time (i.e., before the adversary even interacts with the system). This is called selective security, which is too restrictive for many realistic applications. Achieving adaptive security (also called full security), where security is guaranteed even for messages that are adaptively chosen at any point in time, seems significantly more challenging. The handful of known fully-secure schemes are based on specifically tailored techniques that rely on strong assumptions (such as obfuscation assumptions or multilinear maps assumptions). In this paper we show that any sufficiently expressive selectively-secure FE scheme can be transformed into a fully secure one without introducing any additional assumptions. We present a direct black-box transformation, making novel use of hybrid encryption, a classical technique that was originally introduced for improving the efficiency of encryption schemes, combined with a new technique we call the Trojan Method. This method allows to embed a secret execution thread in the functional keys of the underlying scheme, which will only be activated within the proof of security of the resulting scheme. As another application of the Trojan Method, we show how to construct functional encryption schemes for arbitrary circuits starting from ones for shallow circuits (NC1 or even TC0). ∗E-mail: prabhanjan@cs.ucla.edu.

Bilinear forms are a general class of quadratic functions that includes, for instance, multivariate quadratic polynomials. Our realization works over asymmetric bilinear groups and is surprisingly simple, efficient and easy to implement. For instance, in our scheme the public key and each ciphertext consist of 2n+1 and 4n+2 group elements respectively, where n is the dimension of the encrypted vectors, while secret keys are only two group elements. The scheme is proved secure under the standard (adaptive) indistinguishability based security notion of Boneh, Sahai and Waters (TCC 2011). The proof is rather convoluted and relies on the so-called generic bilinear group model. Specifically, our proof comes in two main stages. In a preliminary step, we put forward and prove a new master theorem to argue hardness in the generic bilinear group model of a broad family of interactive decisional problems, which includes the indistinguishability-based security game for our functional encryption scheme. Next, the more technically involved part of the proof consists in showing that our scheme actually fits the requirements of our master theorem.",

This means that the queries give each individual database no partial information (in the information theoretic or computational sense) on the identity of the item retrieved by the user. All known PIR schemes assume that the user knows the physical address of the sought item. This is usually not the case when accessing a public database that is not managed by the user. Such databases are typically presented with keywords, which are then internally translated (at the database end) to physical addresses, using an appropriate search structure (for example, a hash table or a binary tree). In this note we describe a simple, modular way to privately access data by keywords. It combines any conventional search structure with any underlying PIR scheme (including single server schemes). The transformation requires no modiication in the way that the search structure is maintained. Therefore the same database will support both private and regular (non private) searches.",

      "abstract": "Nowadays, achieving cryptosystems secure in an asynchronous network like the Internet is demanded to be necessary, where concurrent non-malleable proof-of-knowledge and universal composability are among the most powerful and fundamental security properties. But, when achieving more and more complex cryptosystems secure in an open network like the Internet, it is often the case that generic solutions are either impossible or infeasible. In this work, we investigate highly practical approaches for achieving non-malleable cryptosystems secure against concurrent man-in-the-middles. We start our study with the DiffieHellman key-exchange (DHKE) protocol, which is at the root of public-key cryptography and is one of the main pillars of both theory and practice of cryptography. We develop the mechanisms of non-malleable joint proof-of-knowledge (NMJPOK) and self-sealed joint proof-of-knowledge (SSJPOK), which are of independent values. In particular, using NMJPOK and SSJPOK as the key building tools, we present a new family of DHKE protocols, with remarkable performance among security, privacy, efficiency and easy deployment. Particularly important to applied crypto engineering, the newly developed DHKE protocols add novelties and values to a range of key industry standards for ensuring network security (e.g., IKE, (H)MQV, SSH, etc). Along the way, we also reinvestigate the security definition frameworks for DHKE, and clarify various subtleties surrounding the design and analysis of non-malleable DHKE protocols. Then, motivated by the building tools, NMJPOK and SSJPOK, proposed and justified in this work, we formulate non-malleable extractable joint one-way function (NME-JOWF), and demonstrate general applications of NME-JOWF (including 3-round CNMZK and UCZK in the plain model). Then, we propose candidates of NME-JOWF based upon bilinear pairings, and show various concrete applications of the pairing-based NME-JOWF candidates. ∗Institute for Theoretical Computer Science (ITCS), Tsinghua University, Beijing, China. andrewcyao@tsinghua.edu.cn †Software School, Fudan University, Shanghai 200433, China. ylzhao@fudan.edu.cn",

PIR can be achieved using mutuallydistrustful replicated databases, trusted hardware, or cryptography. In this paper we focus on the later setting which is known as single-database computationally- Private Information Retrieval (cPIR). Classic cPIR protocols require that the database server executes an algorithm over all the database content at very low speeds which impairs their usage. In [1], given certain assumptions, realistic at the time, Sion and Carbunar showed that cPIR schemes were not practical and most likely would never be. To this day, this conclusion is widely accepted by researchers and practitioners. Using the paradigm shift introduced by lattice-based cryptography, we show that the conclusion of Sion and Carbunar is not valid anymore: cPIR is of practical value. This is achieved without compromising security, using standard crytosystems, and conservative parameter choices.",

We present two efficient protocols which implement robust threshold RSA signature schemes, where the power to sign is shared by N players such that any subset of T+1 or more signers can collaborate to produce a valid RSA signature on any given message, but no subset of T or less corrupted players can forge a signature. Our protocols are robust in the sense that the correct signature is computed even if up to T players behave in an arbitrarily malicious way during the signature protocol. This, in particular, includes the cases of players who refuse to participate or who introduce erroneous values into the computation. Our robust protocols achieve optimal resiliency as they can tolerate up to (N-1)/2 faults, and their efficiency is comparable with the efficiency of the underlying threshold RSA signature scheme. Our protocols require RSA moduli which are the product of two safe primes, and that the underlying (centralized) RSA signature scheme is unforgeable. Our techniques also apply to the secure sharing of the RSA decryption function. We show that adding robustness to the existing threshold RSA schemes reduces to solving the problem of how to verify an RSA signature without a public verification",

One important security property that has been considered is that of fairness which guarantees that if one party learns the output then so does the other. In the case of two-party computation, fairness is not always possible, and in particular two parties cannot fairly toss a coin (Cleve, 1986). Despite this, it is actually possible to securely compute many two-party functions with fairness (Gordon et al., 2008 and follow-up work). However, all known two-party protocols that achieve fairness have the unique property that the effective input of the corrupted party is determined at an arbitrary point in the protocol. This is in stark contrast to almost all other known protocols that have an explicit fixed round at which the inputs are committed.",

Apart from the validity of the equations, no other information about the modulus (e.g., a generator whose order equals the modulus) or any other operand is exposed. Our techniques can be generalized to prove that any multivariate modular polynomial equation is satisfied, where only commitments to the variables of the polynomial and to the modulus need to be known.

Introduced by Yao under the name millionaires’ problem [Yao86], secure comparisons have received a great deal of attention. They have proven to be one of the most fundamental building block in a large variety of multiparty computation protocols. However, due to their inherent non-arithmetic structure, they are in general less efficient than other fundamental primitives, and as such, are often a major bottleneck in multiparty computation protocols. In this work, we design new two-party protocols for the greater-than functionality, secure against honest-but-curious adversaries (who follow the specifications of the protocol), improving over the state of the art. They can be readily used in a large variety of applications in which secure comparisons constitute the main efficiency bottleneck. Our protocols are defined in the preprocessing model, and are extremely efficient during the online phase. They are based solely on oblivious transfers, and can therefore use oblivious transfer extensions to get rid of all but a constant amount of expensive computations. Toward our goal of secure comparison, we also design protocols for testing equality between private inputs, which improve similarly over the state of the art.

      "abstract": "Adaptive security is a strong corruption model that captures \"hacking\" attacks where an external attacker breaks into parties' machines in the midst of a protocol execution. There are two types of adaptively-secure protocols: adaptive with erasures and adaptive without erasures. Achieving adaptivity without erasures is preferable, since secure erasures are not always trivial. However, it seems far harder. We introduce a new model of adaptive security called adaptive security with partial erasures that allows erasures, but only assumes them in a minimal sense. Specifically, if all parties are corrupted then security holds as long as any single party successfully erases. In addition, security holds if any proper subset of the parties is corrupted without erasures. We initiate a theoretical study of this new notion and demonstrate that secure computation in this setting is as efficient as static secure computation. In addition, we study the relations between semi-adaptive security [GWZ09], adaptive security with partial erasures, and adaptive security without any erasures. We prove that the existence of semi-adaptive OT implies secure computation in all these settings.",

On the flip side, we find that for protocols that nest the encrytion function (use ciphertexts created by enciphering ciphertexts themselves), such an equivalence fails to hold: there exist protocols that use nested encryption, are secure against single miscreants but are insecure against collusions. Our equivalence and separation results are first proven in a symbolic, Dolev-Yao style adversarial model and subsequently translated into the computational model using a general theorem that establishes soundness of the symbolic security notions. Both equivalence and separation are shown to hold in the computational world under mild syntactic conditions (like the absence of encryption cycles). We apply our results to the security analysis of 11 existing key distribution protocols. As part of our analysis, we uncover security weaknesses in 7 of these protocols, and provide simple fixes that result in provably secure protocols.",

      "abstract": "Bitcoin utilizes Nakamoto Consensus to achieve agreement on a consistent set of transactions, in the permissionless setting, where anyone can participate in the protocol anonymously. Since its rise, many other permissionless consensus protocols have been proposed. We present SPECTRE, a new protocol for the consensus core of cryptocurrencies that remains secure even under high throughput and fast confirmation times. At any throughput, SPECTRE is resilient to attackers with up to 50% of the computational power (reaching the limit defined by network congestion and bandwidth constraints). SPECTRE can operate at arbitrarily high block creation rates, which implies that its transactions confirm in mere seconds (limited mostly by the round-trip-time in the network). SPECTRE’s underlying model falls into the category of partial synchronous networks: its security depends on the existence of some bound on the delivery time of messages between honest participants, but the protocol itself does not contain any parameter that depends on this bound. Hence, while other protocols that do encode such parameters must operate with extreme safety margins, SPECTRE converges according to the actual network delay. Key to SPECTRE’s achievements is the fact that it satisfies weaker properties than classic consensus requires. In the conventional paradigm, the order between any two transactions must be decided and agreed upon by all non-corrupt nodes. In contrast, SPECTRE only satisfies this with respect to transactions performed by honest users. We observe that in the context of money, two conflicting payments that are published concurrently could only have been created by a dishonest user, hence we can afford to delay the acceptance of such transactions without harming the usability of the system. Our framework formalizes this weaker set of requirements for a cryptocurrency’s distributed ledger. We then provide a formal proof that SPECTRE satisfies these requirements.",

Constructions of such protocols prove membership in languages consisting of very large yet succinctly-represented constraint satisfaction problems that, alas, are unnatural in the sense that the problems that arise in practice are not in such form. For general computation tasks, the most natural representation is typically as random-access machine (RAM) algorithms, because such a representation can be obtained very efficiently by applying a compiler to code written in a high-level programming language. Thus, understanding the efficiency of reductions from RAM computations to other NP-complete problem representations for which succinct arguments (or proofs) are known is a prerequisite to a more complete understanding of the applicability of these arguments.\n Existing succinct argument constructions rely either on circuit satisfiability or (in PCP-based constructions) on algebraic constraint satisfaction problems. In this paper, we present new and more efficient reductions from RAM (and parallel RAM) computations to both problems that (a) preserve succinctness (i.e., do not \"unroll\" the computation of a machine), (b) preserve zero-knowledge and proof-of-knowledge properties, and (c) enjoy fast and highly-parallelizable algorithms for transforming a witness for the RAM computation into a witness for the corresponding problem. These additional properties are typically not considered in \"classical\" complexity theory but are often required or very desirable in the application of succinct arguments.\n Fulfilling all these efficiency requirements poses significant technical challenges, and we develop a set of tools (both unconditional and leveraging computational assumptions) for generically and efficiently structuring and arithmetizing RAM computations for use in succinct arguments. More generally, our results can be applied to proof systems for NP relying on the aforementioned problem representations; these include various zero-knowledge proof constructions.",

      "abstract": "Cloud providers are realizing the outsourced database model in the form of database-as-a-service offerings. However, security in terms of data privacy remains an obstacle because data storage and processing are performed on an untrusted cloud. Achieving strong security under additional constraints of functionality and performance is even more challenging, for which advanced encryption and recent trusted computing primitives alone prove insufficient. In this paper, we propose PRAMOD – a novel framework for enabling efficient and secure database-as-a-service. We consider a setting in which data is stored encrypted on the untrusted cloud and data-dependent computations are performed inside a trusted environment. The proposed framework protects against leakage caused by observable data movement between different components (due to limited secure memory) by using a special component called scrambler running inO(n) time. It supports popular algorithms underlying many data management applications, including sort, compaction, join and group aggregation. The algorithms implemented in PRAMOD are not only privacy-preserving but also asymptotically optimal. They can be used as building blocks to construct efficient and secure query processing algorithms. The experimental study shows reasonable overheads over a baseline system assuring a weaker level of security. More remarkably, PRAMOD shows superior performance in comparison with the state-of-the-art solutions offering similar privacy protection: up to 4.4× speedup over the alternative data-oblivious algorithms.",

Furthermore, we apply 3-multiplicative LSSS to the computation of unbounded fan-in multiplication, which reduces its round complexity to four (from five of the previous protocol based on strongly multiplicative LSSS). We also give two constructions of 3-multiplicative LSSS from Reed-Muller codes and algebraic geometric codes. We believe that the construction and verification of 3-multiplicative LSSS are easier than those of strongly multiplicative LSSS.

We show the following obstacles to proving this conjecture: \n \n1 We construct a public-key bit-encryption scheme that is plausibly semantically secure, but is not circular secure. The circular security attack manages to fully recover the private-key. \n \nThe construction is based on an extension of the Symmetric External Diffie-Hellman assumption (SXDH) from bilinear groups, to l-multilinear groups of order p where l≥c ·logp for some c>1. \n \nWhile there do exist l-multilinear groups (unconditionally), for l≥3 there are no known candidates for which the SXDH problem is believed to be hard. Nevertheless, there is also no evidence that such groups do not exist. Our result shows that in order to prove the folklore conjecture, one must rule out the possibility that there exist l-multilinear groups for which SXDH is hard. \n \n2 We show that the folklore conjecture cannot be proved using a black-box reduction. That is, there is no reduction of circular security of a bit-encryption scheme to semantic security of that very same scheme that uses both the encryption scheme and the adversary as black-boxes. \n \nBoth of our negative results extend also to the (seemingly) weaker conjecture that every CCA secure bit-encryption scheme is circular secure. \n \nAs a final contribution, we show an equivalence between three seemingly distinct notions of circular security for public-key bit-encryption schemes. In particular, we give a general search to decision reduction that shows that an adversary that distinguishes between encryptions of the bits of the private-key and encryptions of zeros can be used to actually recover the private-key.",

All our simulations are simple, randomized, and computationally efficient. \n \nThe rates of our coding schemes stand in contrast to the interactive communication rates supported by random or adversarial error channels without feedback, for which the best known coding schemes achieve rates of 1 − Θ([EQUATION]e) and 1 − Θ([EQUATION]e log log 1/e), respectively. As these rates are conjectured to be optimal, our result implies a large asymptotic gap between interactive communication rate over noisy channels with and without feedback.

      "abstract": "Existing software-based data erasure programs can be summarized as following the same one-bit-return protocol: the deletion program performs data erasure and returns either success or failure. However, such a one-bit-return protocol turns the data deletion system into a black box-the user has to trust the outcome but cannot easily verify it. This is especially problematic when the deletion program is encapsulated within a Trusted Platform Module (TPM), and the user has no access to the code inside. In this paper, we present a cryptographic solution that aims to make the data deletion process more transparent and verifiable. In contrast to the conventional black/white assumptions about TPM (i.e., either completely trust or distrust), we introduce a third assumption that sits in between: namely, “trust-but-verify”. Our solution enables a user to verify the correct implementation of two important operations inside a TPM without accessing its source code: i.e., the correct encryption of data and the faithful deletion of the key. Finally, we present a proof-of-concept implementation of the SSE system on a resource-constrained Java card to demonstrate its practical feasibility. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic solution to the secure data deletion problem based on a “trust-but-verify” paradigm, together with a concrete prototype implementation.",

For this setting we study if and under what assumptions such provers can admit an extractor. Our contribution is mainly threefold. \n \nFirst, we formalize the question of extraction in the presence of oracles by proposing a suitable proof of knowledge definition for this setting. We call SNARKs satisfying this definition O-SNARKs. Second, we show how to use O-SNARKs to obtain formal and intuitive security proofs for three applications homomorphic signatures, succinct functional signatures, and SNARKs on authenticated data where we recognize an issue while doing the proof under the standard proof of knowledge definition of SNARKs. Third, we study whether O-SNARKs exist, providing both negative and positive results. On the negative side, we show that, assuming one way functions, there do not exist O-SNARKs in the standard model for every signing oracle family and thus for general oracle families as well. On the positive side, we show that when considering signature schemes with appropriate restrictions on the message length O-SNARKs for the corresponding signing oracles exist, based on classical SNARKs and assuming extraction with respect to specific distributions of auxiliary input.",

      "abstract": "Protection of data privacy and prevention of unwarranted information disclosure is an enduring challenge in cloud computing when data analytics is performed on an untrusted third-party resource. Recent advances in trusted processor technology, such as Intel SGX, have rejuvenated the efforts of performing data analytics on a shared platform where data security and trustworthiness of computations are ensured by the hardware. However, a powerful adversary may still be able to infer private information in this setting from side channels such as cache access, CPU usage and other timing channels, thereby threatening data and user privacy. Though studies have proposed techniques to hide such information leaks through carefully designed data-independent access paths, such techniques can be prohibitively slow on models with large number of parameters, especially when employed in a real-time analytics application. In this paper, we introduce a defense strategy that can achieve higher computational efficiency with a small trade-off in privacy protection. In particular, we study a strategy that adds noise to traces of memory access observed by an adversary, with the use of dummy data instances. We quantitatively measure privacy guarantee, and empirically demonstrate the effectiveness and limitation of this randomization strategy, using classification and clustering algorithms. Our results show significant reduction in execution time overhead on real-world data sets, when compared to a defense strategy using only data-oblivious mechanisms.",

      "abstract": "Predicate encryption is an important cryptographic primitive that has been recently studied [BDOP04, BW07, GPSW06, KSW08] and that has found wide applications. Roughly speaking, in a predicate encryption scheme the owner of the master secret key K can derive secret key $\\tilde K$, for any pattern vector k . In encrypting a message M , the sender can specify an attribute vector x and the resulting ciphertext $\\tilde X$ can be decrypted only by using keys $\\tilde K$ such that P (x , k ) = 1, for a fixed predicate P . A predicate encryption scheme thus gives the owner of the master secret key fine-grained control on which ciphertexts can be decrypted and this allows him to delegate the decryption of different types of messages (as specified by the attribute vector) to different entities. \n \nIn this paper, we give a construction for hidden vector encryption which is a special case of predicate encryption schemes introduced by [BW07]. Here the ciphertext attributes are vectors x = ***x 1 ,...x l *** over alphabet Σ, key patterns are vectors k = ***k 1 ,...k l *** over alphabet Σ *** {*} and we consider the Match(x, k) predicate which is true if and only if k i *** * implies x i = k i . Besides guaranteeing the security of the attributes of a ciphertext, our construction also gives security guarantees for the key patterns. We stress that security guarantees for key patterns only make sense in a private-key setting and have been recently considered by [SSW09] which gave a construction in the symmetric bilinear setting with groups of composite (product of four primes) order. In contrast, our construction uses asymmetric bilinear groups of prime order and the length of the key is equal to the weight of the pattern, thus resulting in an increased efficiency. We remark that our construction is based on falsifiable (in the sense of [BW06, Nao03]) complexity assumptions for the asymmetric bilinear setting and are proved secure in the standard model (that is, without random oracles).",

These conditions mean that the protocol starts with the input being secret-shared with each share of each input field element being a field element, all combinations are used, and the output is shared in the same way as input. In this report a weaker property of the secret sharing scheme that still allows to prove a linear (w.r.t. the number of multiplications) lower bound on communication is presented. Namely, if we have two (out of three) sides and two options for each party’s shares and three possible combinations decode as the same value, the remaining combination should also be a valid pair of shares and reveal the same value.",

This scenario poses many interesting technical challenges, which are addressed with cryptographic tools that introduce significant computational and communication overheads (e.g. zero-knowledge proofs). In this paper, we consider the case of games that do not require any secret state to be maintained (e.g. Blackjack and Baccarat). Basically, in these games, cards are chosen at random and then publicly advertised, allowing for players to publicly announce their actions (before or after cards are known). We show that protocols for such games can be built from very lightweight primitives such as digital signatures and canonical random oracle commitments, yielding constructions that far outperform all known card game protocols in terms of communication, computational and round complexities. Moreover, in constructing highly efficient protocols, we introduce a new technique based on verifiable random functions for extending coin tossing, which is at the core of our constructions. Besides ensuring that the games are played correctly, our protocols support financial rewards and penalties enforcement, guaranteeing that winners receive their rewards and that cheaters get financially penalized. In order to do so, we build on blockchain-based techniques that leverage the power of stateful smart contracts to ensure fair protocol execution.",

This problem, known as public key encryption with sender recovery has intuitive solutions based on hybrid encryption-based key encapsulation mechanism and data encapsulation mechanism (KEM/DEM) schemes. We propose a KEM/DEM-based solution that is CCA2-secure, allows for multiple receivers, only requires the receivers to be equipped with public/secret keypairs (the sender needs only a single symmetric recovery key), and uses an analysis technique called plaintext randomization that results in greatly simplified, clean, and intuitive proofs compared to prior work in this area.

The even more ambitious project of using such a grammar to give an integrated definition of both syntax and semantics of ALGOL 68 has been undertaken by the author but is still far from completion. Experience in these and other applications, e.g., to prove program correctness [5], have shown that although these grammars have the same generative power as Turing machines, they are much more manageable. An obvious question is the reason of this manageability. Certainly, a judicious choice of metanotions is of considerable value and in the big tasks, like the description of full-scale languages, a large number of metanotions are used.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that ensures predicate privacy in the public-key settings without requiring interactions between the receiver and potential senders, the size of which may be very large. Moreover, we identify a new type of attacks against PEKS, i.e., statistical guessing attacks. Accordingly, we introduce a new notion called statistics privacy, i.e., the property that predicate privacy is preserved even when the statistical distribution of keywords is known. The second scheme we proposed makes a tradeoff between statistics privacy and storage efficiency (of the delegate).

Their bytecode is public, immutable and once deployed to the blockchain, cannot be patched anymore. As smart contracts may hold Ether worth of several million dollars, they are attractive targets for attackers and indeed some contracts have successfully been exploited in the recent past, resulting in tremendous financial losses. The correctness of smart contracts is thus of utmost importance. While first approaches on formal verification exist, they demand users to be well-versed in formal methods which are alien to many developers and are only able to analyze individual contracts, without considering their execution environment, i.e., calls to external contracts, sequences of transaction, and values from the actual blockchain storage. In this paper, we present Annotary, a concolic execution framework to analyze smart contracts for vulnerabilities, supported by annotations which developers write directly in the Solidity source code. In contrast to existing work, Annotary supports analysis of inter-transactional, inter-contract control flows and combines symbolic execution of EVM bytecode with a resolution of concrete values from the public Ethereum blockchain. While the analysis of Annotary tends to weight precision higher than soundness, we analyze inter-transactional call chains to eliminate false positives from unreachable states that traditional symbolic execution would not be able to handle. We present the annotation and analysis concepts of Annotary, explain its implementation on top of the Laser symbolic virtual machine, and demonstrate its usage as a plugin for the Sublime Text editor.",

Provable data possession (PDP)/proofs of retrievability (PoR), for which various constructions exist, are concepts to solve this issue. Interestingly, by now, no PDP/PoR scheme leading to an efficient construction supporting both private and public verifiability simultaneously is known. In particular, this means that up to now all PDP/PoR schemes either allow public or private verifiability exclusively, since different setup procedures and metadata sets are required. However, supporting both variants simultaneously seems interesting, as publicly verifiable schemes are far less efficient than privately verifiable ones. In this paper, we propose the first simultaneous privately and publicly verifiable (robust) PDP protocol, which allows the data owner to use the more efficient private verification and anyone else to run the public verification algorithm. Our construction, which is based on elliptic curves, achieves this, as it uses the same setup procedure and the same metadata set for private and public verifiability. We provide a rigorous security analysis and prove our construction secure in the random oracle model under the assumption that the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem is intractable. We give detailed comparisons with the most efficient existing approaches for either private or public verifiability with our proposed scheme in terms of storage and communication overhead, as well as computational effort for the client and the server. Our analysis shows that for choices of parameters, which are relevant for practical applications, our construction outperforms all existing privately and publicly verifiable schemes significantly. This means, that even when our construction is used for either private or public verifiability alone, it still outperforms the most efficient constructions known, which is particularly appealing in the public verifiability setting.",

      "abstract": "Dynamic binary taint analysis has wide applications in the security analysis of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) binaries. One of the key challenges in dynamic binary analysis is to specify the taint rules that capture how taint information propagates for each instruction on an architecture. Most of the existing solutions specify taint rules using a deductive approach by summarizing the rules manually after analyzing the instruction semantics. Intuitively, taint propagation reflects on how an instruction input affects its output, and thus can be observed from instruction executions. In this work, we propose an inductive method for taint propagation and develop a universal taint tracking engine that is architecture-agnostic. Our taint engine, TAINTINDUCE, can learn taint rules with minimal architectural knowledge by observing the execution behavior of instructions. To measure its correctness and guide taint rule generation, we define the precise notion of soundness for bit-level taint tracking in this novel setup. In our evaluation, we show that TAINTINDUCE automatically learns rules for 4 widely used architectures: x86, x64, AArch64, and MIPS-I. It can detect vulnerabilities for 24 CVEs in 15 applications on both Linux and Windows over millions of instructions and is comparable with other mature existing tools (TEMU [51], libdft [32], Triton [42]). TAINTINDUCE can be used as a stand-alone taint engine or be used to complement existing taint engines for unhandled instructions. Further, it can be used as a cross-referencing tool to uncover bugs in taint engines, emulation implementations and ISA documentations.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The complexity of a secret sharing scheme is defined as the ratio between the maximum length of the shares and the length of the secret. The optimization of this parameter for general access structures is an important and very difficult open problem in secret sharing. We explore in this paper the connections of this open problem with matroids and polymatroids. Matroid ports were introduced by Lehman in 1964. A forbidden minor characterization of matroid ports was given by Seymour in 1976. These results precede the invention of secret sharing by Shamir in 1979. Important connections between ideal secret sharing schemes and matroids were discovered by Brickell and Davenport in 1991. Their results can be restated as follows: every ideal secret sharing scheme defines a matroid, and its access structure is a port of that matroid. Our main result is a lower bound on the optimal complexity of access structures that are not matroid ports. Namely, by using the aforementioned characterization of matroid ports by Seymour, we generalize the result by Brickell and Davenport by proving that, if the length of every share in a secret sharing scheme is less than 3/2 times the length of the secret, then its access structure is a matroid port. This generalizes and explains a phenomenon that was observed in several families of access structures. In addition, we introduce a new parameter to represent the best lower bound on the optimal complexity that can be obtained by taking into account that the joint Shannon entropies of a set of random variables define a polymatroid. We prove that every bound that is obtained by this technique for an access structure applies to its dual as well. Finally, we present a construction of linear secret sharing schemes for the ports of the Vamos and the non-Desargues matroids. In this way new upper bounds on their optimal complexity are obtained, which are a contribution on the search of access structures whose optimal complexity lies between 1 and 3/2.",

The framework allows capturing different levels of leakage-tolerance of protocols, namely the preservation (or degradation) of security, under coordinated attacks that include various forms of leakage from the secret states of participating components. The framework extends the universally composable (UC) security framework. We also prove a variant of the UC theorem that enables modular design and analysis of protocols even in face of general, non-modular leakage. \n \nWe then construct leakage-tolerant protocols for basic tasks, such as secure message transmission, message authentication, commitment, oblivious transfer and zero-knowledge. A central component in several of our constructions is the observation that resilience to adaptive party corruptions (in some strong sense) implies leakage-tolerance in an essentially optimal way.",

One of the technologies that can be used to ensure secure NFC transactions is cloud computing which offers wide range advantages compare to the use of a Secure Element (SE) as a single entity in an NFC enabled mobile phone. In this paper, we propose a protocol based on the concept of NFC mobile payments. Accordingly, we present an extended version of the NFC cloud Wallet model [14], in which, the Secure Element in the mobile device is used for customer authentication whereas the customer's banking credentials are stored in a cloud under the control of the Mobile Network Operator (MNO). In this circumstance, Mobile Network Operator plays the role of network carrier which is responsible for controlling all the credentials transferred to the end user. The proposed protocol eliminates the requirement of a shared secret between the Point-of-Sale (POS) and the Mobile Network Operator before execution of the protocol, a mandatory requirement in the earlier version of this protocol [16].

The results can be verified privately or publicly. Fiore and Gennaro CCS 2012 constructed publicly verifiable protocols for secure outsourcing polynomials and matrix computations. Batch verifiable computation BVC schemes allow a client to outsource multiple functions on a same input, and thus much reduce the storage overhead at the server side without sacrificing the efficiency of verification. However, existing BVC schemes only support private verifiability which only allows the client who outsources the computations to verify the results. In this paper, we propose BVC schemes with public verifiability, i.e., any third party can efficiently verify the results returned by the server without accessing secret key. To delegate s functions, our BVC schemes require a cloud storage of only $$1+1/s$$ times the storage size needed by the s functions themselves. We extend our schemes to meet less cloud storage overhead as well.",

The proposed unbounded IPE schemes are fully (adaptively) secure and fully attribute-hiding in the standard model under a standard assumption, the decisional linear (DLIN) assumption. In our unbounded IPE schemes, the inner-product relation is generalized, where the two vectors of inner-product can be different sizes and it provides a great improvement of efficiency in many applications. We also present the first fully secure unbounded attribute-based encryption (ABE) schemes, and the security is proven under the DLIN assumption in the standard model.

      "abstract": "It is well-known that a program's memory access pattern can leak information about its input. To thwart such leakage, most existing works adopt the technique of oblivious RAM (ORAM) simulation. Such an obliviousness notion has stimulated much debate. Although ORAM techniques have significantly improved over the past few years, the concrete overheads are arguably still undesirable for real-world systems --- part of this overhead is in fact inherent due to a well-known logarithmic ORAM lower bound by Goldreich and Ostrovsky. To make matters worse, when the program's runtime or output length depend on secret inputs, it may be necessary to perform worst-case padding to achieve full obliviousness and thus incur possibly super-linear overheads. \n \nInspired by the elegant notion of differential privacy, we initiate the study of a new notion of access pattern privacy, which we call \"(ϵ, δ)-differential obliviousness\". We separate the notion of (ϵ, δ)-differential obliviousness from classical obliviousness by considering several fundamental algorithmic abstractions including sorting small-length keys, merging two sorted lists, and range query data structures (akin to binary search trees). We show that by adopting differential obliviousness with reasonable choices of ϵ and δ, not only can one circumvent several impossibilities pertaining to full obliviousness, one can also, in several cases, obtain meaningful privacy with little overhead relative to the non-private baselines (i.e., having privacy \"almost for free\"). On the other hand, we show that for very demanding choices of ϵ and δ, the same lower bounds for oblivious algorithms would be preserved for (ϵ, δ)-differential obliviousness.",

However, such an approach will make RSA encryption very time-consuming because the public exponent e in Rebalanced RSA-CRT will be of the same order of magnitude as φ(N). In this paper we study the following problem: does there exist any secure variant of Rebalanced RSA-CRT, whose public exponent e is much shorter than φ(N)?

The advantage of this approach is that the outputs of the PRF can be cached for frequently needed message parts. We demonstrate the merits of MergeMAC for authenticating messages on the CAN bus where bandwidth is extremely limited and caching can be used to recover parts of the message counter instead of transmitting it.

To verify a module separated from the other components we have to assume some (correct) behaviour of these components concerning the interactions with the module under consideration. These reactions of the other modules can be described by liveness properties. Hence in a modular verification method we have to prove a formula under some liveness assumptions. A logic which is able to express the correctness of a subsystem under some liveness assumptions is e.g. CTL* or only its linear time part TL. But modelchecking for CTL* is exponential in the size of a given formula. Hence, often CTL is used instead of CTL* in specifications of concurrent systems as this logic has a linear modelchecking algorithm. But CTL has a restricted expressive power, e.g. it is not expressible that some property holds under some liveness assumption. But, as an algorithm which is exponential in the size of a given specification is too expensive, we are interested in an extension of CTL which is able to express our specifications for modules but whose modelchecking algorithm is better than exponential in the size of a given formula. In this paper we define a logic LCTL, which is an extension of CTL, where quantifications over paths are interpreted with respect to some liveness assumptions. i.e., formulae of LCTL are pairs (l,f) where I is a liveness assumption (expressed in TL) and f is a CTL formula. In that case the time complexity of the modelchecking algorithm has certainly an exponential factor, but it is better than the algorithm for CTL* since it is only exponential in the number of liveness assumptions and not in the length of the whole formula. As the number of liveness assumptions is small in real systems, this logic is useful for practical purposes. Furthermore, as liveness assumptions require a tracing of the history, there is no better modelchecking algorithm nor a smaller logic possible. For our logic LCTL we develop a modelchecker whose time complexity is O(|M|·|f|·exp(n)), where M is a given structure, (i,f) the given formula where I is a conjunction of n liveness assumptions.",

A result of Wooley allows us to relate algebraic rank and min-entropy and to show that a rank extractor is also a high quality condenser for polynomial sources over polynomially large fields.

In this setting, we show that in the absence of mutation, the population goes extinct, but in the presence of mutation, the population survives with positive probability.

We provide the first, to our knowledge, polynomial convergence bound for noisy MWU in a coordination game. Finally, we also show that in static environments, sexual evolution with mutation converges, for any level of mutation.",

Although the research community has made significant progress in theory and in labs, meltdowns in recent years suggest that we're still struggling to address systemic privacy issues. Privacy engineering, an emerging field, responds to this gap between research and practice. It's concerned with systematizing and evaluating approaches to capture and address privacy issues with engineering information systems. This article serves to illuminate this nascent field. The authors provide a definition of privacy engineering and describe encompassing activities. They expand on these with findings from the First International Workshop on Privacy Engineering (IWPE), and conclude with future challenges.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents a byte-oriented stream cipher - Loiss, which takes a 128-bit initial key and a 128-bit initial vector as inputs, and outputs a keystream in bytes. The algorithm is based on a linear feedback shift register, and uses a structure called BOMM in the filter generator, which has good property on resisting algebraic attacks, linear distinguishing attacks and fast correlation attacks. In order for the BOMM to be balanced, the S-boxes in the BOMM must be orthomorphic permutations. To further improve the capability in resisting against those attacks, the S-boxes in the BOMM must also possess some good cryptographic properties, for example, high algebraic immunity, high nonlinearity, and so on. However current researches on orthomorphic permutations pay little attention on their cryptographic properties, and we believe that the proposal of Loiss will enrich the application of orthomorphic permutations in cryptography, and also motivate the research on a variety of cryptographic properties of orthomorphic permutations.",

      "abstract": "We consider the problem of maintaining an (approximately) minimum vertex cover in an n-node graph G = (V,E) that is getting updated dynamically via a sequence of edge insertions/deletions. We show how to maintain a (2 + ǫ)-approximate minimum vertex cover, deterministically, in this setting in O(1/ǫ) amortized update time. Prior to our work, the best known deterministic algorithm for maintaining a (2 + ǫ)-approximate minimum vertex cover was due to Bhattacharya, Henzinger and Italiano [SODA 2015]. Their algorithm has an update time of O(log n/ǫ). Recently, Bhattacharya, Chakrabarty, Henzinger [IPCO 2017] and Gupta, Krishnaswamy, Kumar, Panigrahi [STOC 2017] showed how to maintain an O(1)-approximation in O(1)-amortized update time for the same problem. Our result gives an exponential improvement over the update time of Bhattacharya et al. [SODA 2015], and nearly matches the performance of the randomized algorithm of Solomon [FOCS 2016] who gets an approximation ratio of 2 and an expected amortized update time of O(1). We derive our result by analyzing, via a novel technique, a variant of the algorithm by Bhattacharya et al. We consider an idealized setting where the update time of an algorithm can take any arbitrary fractional value, and use insights from this setting to come up with an appropriate potential function. Conceptually, this framework mimics the idea of an LP-relaxation for an optimization problem. The difference is that instead of relaxing an integral objective function, we relax the update time of an algorithm itself. We believe that this technique will find further applications in the analysis of dynamic algorithms. University of Warwick, Coventry, UK.

The state of any family member is made of three components: a counter, a counter diffusor and a core accumulator. We show that collisions can be found in the counter during the IV Setup. Moreover they can be combined with a collision in the linear counter diffusor to form collisions on the whole cipher. As a consequence, it is possible to retrieve 53 bits of the keyed state of the stream cipher by performing a chosen IV attack. For the default member of a VEST family, we present a \"long\" IV attack which requires 222.24 IV setups, and a \"short\" IV attack which requires 228.73 IV setups on average. The 53 bits retrieved can be used to reduce the complexity of the exhaustive key search. The chosen IV attack can be turned into a chosen message attack on a MAC based on VEST.",

      "abstract": "Decompilation is important for many security applications; it facilitates the tedious task of manual malware reverse engineering and enables the use of source-based security tools on binary code. This includes tools to find vulnerabilities, discover bugs, and perform taint tracking. Recovering high-level control constructs is essential for decompilation in order to produce structured code that is suitable for human analysts and sourcebased program analysis techniques. State-of-the-art decompilers rely on structural analysis, a pattern-matching approach over the control flow graph, to recover control constructs from binary code. Whenever no match is found, they generate goto statements and thus produce unstructured decompiled output. Those statements are problematic because they make decompiled code harder to understand and less suitable for program analysis. In this paper, we present DREAM, the first decompiler to offer a goto-free output. DREAM uses a novel patternindependent control-flow structuring algorithm that can recover all control constructs in binary programs and produce structured decompiled code without any goto statement. We also present semantics-preserving transformations that can transform unstructured control flow graphs into structured graphs. We demonstrate the correctness of our algorithms and show that we outperform both the leading industry and academic decompilers: Hex-Rays and Phoenix. We use the GNU coreutils suite of utilities as a benchmark. Apart from reducing the number of goto statements to zero, DREAM also produced more compact code (less lines of code) for 72.7% of decompiled functions compared to Hex-Rays and 98.8% compared to Phoenix. We also present a comparison of Hex-Rays and DREAM when decompiling three samples from Cridex, ZeusP2P, and SpyEye malware families.",

We have tried to give as many details possible specially for novice on the subject. Something may be trivial to an expert but not to a novice. Many fundamental problems about lattice are thought to be hard even against quantum computer, compared to factorization problem which can be solved easily with quantum computer, via the celebrated Shor factorization quantum algorithm. The first part of our presentation is based on slides of Christ Peikert 2013 Bonn lecture (crypt@b-it2013). We, more or less, give somewhat detailed explanation of Professor Peikert’s lecture slides. We unfortunately could not attend his Bonn class. We are afraid that there are many mistakes in this note; if any, they are due to our misunderstanding of the material. Part II of our lecture note is on ring LWE, based on the paper “A tool-kit for Ring-LWE Cryptography” by Lyubashevsky, Peikert and Regev. Part III is about multilinear maps together with cryptanalysis of GGH map due to Hu and Jia. Our presentation follows professor Steinfeld’s lecture slides on GGHLite, and the paper by Yupu Hu and Huiwen Jia. When you read this lecture note, the corresponding original paper should be accompanied. We thank professor Jung Hee Cheon for introducing the subject and asking Dong Pyo Chi to give a lecture on the subject at the department of mathematics in Seoul National University.

Although SINTZOFF showed in [1] that every recursively enumerable set is generated by some such grammar, its use to the description of the full syntax of ALGOL 68 had to wait until recently [4]. The even more ambitious project of using such a grammar to give an integrated definition of both syntax and semantics of ALGOL 68 has been undertaken by the author but is still far from completion. Experience in these and other applications, e.g., to prove program correctness [5], have shown that although these grammars have the same generative power as Turing machines, they are much more manageable. An obvious question is the reason of this manageability. Certainly, a judicious choice of metanotions is of considerable value and in the big tasks, like the description of full-scale languages, a large number of metanotions are used. On the other hand, one might ask whether the ability to generate every recursively enumerable set requires so many metanotions.",

      "abstract": "In this work, we study indistinguishability obfuscation and functional encryption for general circuits: Indistinguishability obfuscation requires that given any two equivalent circuits C0 and C1 of similar size, the obfuscations of C0 and C1 should be computationally indistinguishable. In functional encryption, cipher texts encrypt inputs x and keys are issued for circuits C. Using the key SKC to decrypt a cipher text CTx = Enc(x), yields the value C(x) but does not reveal anything else about x. Furthermore, no collusion of secret key holders should be able to learn anything more than the union of what they can each learn individually. We give constructions for indistinguishability obfuscation and functional encryption that supports all polynomial-size circuits. We accomplish this goal in three steps: - (1) We describe a candidate construction for indistinguishability obfuscation for NC1 circuits. The security of this construction is based on a new algebraic hardness assumption. The candidate and assumption use a simplified variant of multilinear maps, which we call Multilinear Jigsaw Puzzles. (2) We show how to use indistinguishability obfuscation for NC1 together with Fully Homomorphic Encryption (with decryption in NC1) to achieve indistinguishability obfuscation for all circuits. (3) Finally, we show how to use indistinguishability obfuscation for circuits, public-key encryption, and non-interactive zero knowledge to achieve functional encryption for all circuits. The functional encryption scheme we construct also enjoys succinct cipher texts, which enables several other applications.",

This makes our scheme both asymptotically faster and (we believe) easier to understand.",

Our techniques result in fully secure Identity-Based Encryption (IBE) and Hierarchical Identity-Based Encryption (HIBE) systems under the simple and established decisional Bilinear Diffie-Hellman and decisional Linear assumptions. Our IBE system has ciphertexts, private keys, and public parameters each consisting of a constant number of group elements. These results are the first HIBE system and the first IBE system with short parameters under simple assumptions. \n \nIn a Dual System Encryption system both ciphertexts and private keys can take on one of two indistinguishable forms. A private key or ciphertext will be normal if they are generated respectively from the system's key generation or encryption algorithm. These keys and ciphertexts will behave as one expects in an IBE system. In addition, we define semi-functional keys and ciphertexts. A semi-functional private key will be able to decrypt all normally generated ciphertexts; however, decryption will fail if one attempts to decrypt a semi-functional ciphertext with a semi-functional private key. Analogously, semi-functional ciphertexts will be decryptable only by normal private keys. \n \nDual System Encryption opens up a new way to prove security of IBE and related encryption systems. We define a sequence of games where we change first the challenge ciphertext and then the private keys one by one to be semi-functional. We finally end up in a game where the challenge ciphertext and all private keys are semi-functional at which point proving security is straightforward.",

Roughly speaking, functional encryption supports restricted secret keys that enable a key holder to learn a specific function of encrypted data, but learn nothing else about the data. For example, given an encrypted program the secret key may enable the key holder to learn the output of the program on a specific input without learning anything else about the program. \n \nWe show that defining security for functional encryption is non-trivial. First, we show that a natural game-based definition is inadequate for some functionalities. We then present a natural simulation-based definition and show that it (provably) cannot be satisfied in the standard model, but can be satisfied in the random oracle model. We show how to map many existing concepts to our formalization of functional encryption and conclude with several interesting open problems in this young area.",

      "abstract": "It has been shown previously how almost any multiparty protocol problem can be solved. All the constructions suggested so far rely on trapdoor one-way functions, and therefore must assume essentially that public key cryptography is possible. It has also been shown that unconditional protection of a single designated participant is all that can be achieved under that model. Assuming only authenticated secrecy channels between pairs of participants, we show that essentially any multiparty protocol problem can be solved. Such a model actually implies the further requirement that less than one third of the participants deviate from the protocol. The techniques presented do not, however, rely on any cryptographic assumptions; they achieve the optimal result and provide security as good as the secrecy and authentication of the channeis used. Moreover, the constructions have a built-in fault tolerance: once the participants have sent messages committing themselves to the secrets they will use in the protocol, there is no way less than a third of them can stop the protocol from completing correctly. Our technique relies on the so called key-safeguarding or secret-sharing schemes proposed by Blakley and Shamir as basic building blocks. The usefulness of their homomorphic structure was observed by Benaloh, who proposed techniques very similar to ours.",

The total number of bits broadcast is O(nk|C|), where k is the security parameter and |C| is the size of a (Boolean) circuit computing the function to be securely evaluated. An earlier proposal by Franklin and Haber with the same complexity was only secure for passive adversaries, while all earlier protocols with active security had complexity at least quadratic in n.

Because an LSSS neither guarantees reconstructability when some shares are false, nor verifiability of a shared value, nor allows for the multiplication of shared values, an LSSS is an apparently much weaker primitive than VSS or MPC. \n \nOur approach to secure MPC is generic and applies to both the information-theoretic and the cryptographic setting. The construction is based on 1) a formalization of the special multiplicative property of an LSSS that is needed to perform a multiplication on shared values, 2) an efficient generic construction to obtain from any LSSS a multiplicative LSSS for the same access structure, and 3) an efficient generic construction to build verifiability into every LSSS (always assuming that the adversary structure allows for MPC or VSS at all). \n \nThe protocols are efficient. In contrast to all previous information-theoretically secure protocols, the field size is not restricted (e.g, to be greater than n). Moreover, we exhibit adversary structures for which our protocols are polynomial in n while all previous approaches to MPC for non-threshold adversaries provably have super-polynomial complexity.",

In these cases, the protocol requires an interactive 3-pass initial phase, after which each bit (or block of bits) of the signature can be released non-interactively (i.e. by sending 1 message).

We propose a construction of non-committing encryption that can be based on any public-key system which is secure in the ordinary sense and which has an extra property we call simulatability. This generalises an earlier scheme proposed by Beaver based on the Diffie-Hellman problem, and we propose another implementation based on RSA. In a more general setting, our construction can be based on any collection of trapdoor permutations with a certain simulatability property. This offers a considerable efficiency improvement over the first non-committing encryption scheme proposed by Canetti et al. Finally, at some loss of efficiency, our scheme can be based on general collections of trapdoor permutations without the simulatability assumption, and without the common-domain assumption of Canetti et al.
