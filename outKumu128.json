Any group of nodes that finds itself in this set can perform the restricted operations. In this paper, both of these strategies are studied in detail and it is shown that they are not equivalent in general (although they are in some cases).

In this paper we demonstrate the advantages of sweeping with a topological line that is not necessarily straight. We show how an arrangement of n lines in the plane can be swept over in O ( n 2 ) time and O(n) space by a such a line. In the process each element, i.e., vertex, edge, or region, is visited once in a consistent ordering. Our technique makes use of novel data structures which exhibit interesting amortized complexity behavior; the result is an algorithm that improves upon all its predecessors either in the space or the time bounds, as well as being eminently practical. Numerous applications of the technique to problems in computational geometry are given—many through the use of duality transforms. Examples include solving visibility problems, detecting degeneracies in configurations, computing the extremal shadows of convex polytopes, and others. Even though our basic technique solves a planar problem, its applications include several problems in higher dimensions.",

      "abstract": "An interactive proof system is a method by which one party of unlimited resources, called the prover, can convince a party of limited resources, call the verifier, of the truth of a proposition. The verifier may toss coins, ask repeated questions of the prover, and run efficient tests upon the prover's responses before deciding whether to be convinced. This extends the familiar proof system implicit in the notion of NP in that there the verifier may not toss coins or speak, but only listen and verify. Interactive proof systems may not yield proof in the strict mathematical sense: the \"proofs\" are probabilistic with an exponentially small, though non-zero chance of error. We consider two notions of interactive proof system. One, defined by Goldwasser, Micali, and Rackoff [GMR] permits the verifier a coin that can be tossed in private, i.e., a secret source of randomness.

Our main result is that these two systems are equivalent in power with respect to language recognition. The notion of interactive proof system may be seen to yield a probabilistic analog to NP much as BPP is the probabilistic analog to P. We define the probabilistic, nondeterministic, polynomial time Turing machine and show that it is also equivalent in power to these systems.",

It is applied to solve a general class of problems which include most of the two-party cryptographic problems in the literature. Specifically, we show how two parties A and B can interactively generate a random integer N = p?q such that its secret, i.e., the prime factors (p, q), is hidden from either party individually but is recoverable jointly if desired. This can be utilized to give a protocol for two parties with private values i and j to compute any polynomially computable functions f(i,j) and g(i,j) with minimal knowledge transfer and a strong fairness property. As a special case, A and B can exchange a pair of secrets sA, sB, e.g. the factorization of an integer and a Hamiltonian circuit in a graph, in such a way that sA becomes computable by B when and only when sB becomes computable by A. All these results are proved assuming only that the problem of factoring large intergers is computationally intractable.",

      "abstract": "A protocol is presented that allows a set of parties to collectively perform any agreed computation, where every party is able to choose secret inputs and verify that the resulting output is correct, and where all secret inputs are optimally protected. The protocol has the following properties: ? One participant is allowed to hide his secrets unconditionally, i.e. the protocol releases no Shannon information about these secrets. This means that a participant with bounded resources can perform computations securely with a participant who may have unlimited computing power. To the best of our knowledge, our protocol is the first of its kind to provide this possibility. ? The cost of our protocol is linear in the number of gates in a circuit performing the computation, and in the number of participants. We believe it is conceptually simpler and more efficient than other protocols solving related problems ([Y1], [GoMiWi] and [GaHaYu]). It therefore leads to practical solutions of problems involving small circuits. ? The protocol is openly verifiable, i.e. any number of people can later come in and rechallenge any participant to verify that no cheating has occurred. ? The protocol is optimally secure against conspiracies: even if n - 1 out of the n participants collude, they will not find out more about the remaining participants' secrets than what they could already infer from their own input and the public output. ? Each participant has a chance of undetected cheating that is only exponentially small in the amount of time and space needed for the protocol. ? The protocol adapts easily, and with negligible extra cost, to various additional requirements, e.g. making part of the output private to some participant, ensuring that the participants learn the output simultaneously, etc. ? Participants can prove relations between data used in different instances of the protocol, even if those instances involve different groups of participants. For example, it can be proved that the output of one computation was used as input to another, without revealing more about this data. ? The protocol can be usen as an essential tool in proving that all languages in IP have zero knowledge proof systems, i.e. any statement which can be proved interactively can also be proved in zero knowledge.The rest of this paper is organised as follows: First we survey some related results. Then Section 2 gives an intuitive introduction to the protocol. In Section 3, we present one of the main tools used in this paper: bit commitment schemes. Sections 4 and 5 contain the notation, terrninology, etc. used in the paper. In Section 6, the protocol is presented, along with proofs of its security and correctness. In Section 7, we show how to adapt the protocol to various extra requirements and discuss some generalisations and optimisations. Finally, Section 8 contains some remarks on how to construct zero knowledge proof systems for any language in IP.",

This leads to the definition of unrestricted input zero-knowledge proofs of knowledge in which the prover demonstrates possession of knowledge without revealing any computational information whatsoever (not even the one bit revealed in zero-knowledge proofs of assertions). We show the relevance of these notions to identification schemes, in which parties prove their identity by demonstrating their knowledge rather than by proving the validity of assertions. We describe a novel scheme which is provably secure if factoring is difficult and whose practical implementations are about two orders of magnitude faster than RSA-based identification schemes. The advantages of thinking in terms of proofs of knowledge rather than proofs of assertions are demonstrated in two efficient variants of the scheme: unrestricted input zero-knowledge proofs of knowledge are used in the construction of a scheme which needs no directory; a version of the scheme based on parallel interactive proofs (which are not known to be zero knowledge) is proved secure by observing that the identification protocols are proofs of knowledge.",

      "abstract": "At EUROCRYPT'88, we introduced an interactive zero-knowledge protocol (Guillou and Quisquater [13]) fitted to the authentication of tamper-resistant devices (e.g. smart cards, Guillou and Ugon [14]).Each security device stores its secret authentication number, an RSA-like signature computed by an authority from the device identity. Any transaction between a tamper-resistant security device and a verifier is limited to a unique interaction: the device sends its identity and a random test number, then the verifier tells a random large question; and finally the device answers by a witness number. The transaction is successful when the test number is reconstructed from the witness number, the question and the identity according to numbers published by the authority and rules of redundancy possibly standardized.This protocol allows a cooperation between users in such a way that a group of cooperative users looks like a new entity, having a shadowed identity the product of the individual shadowed identities, while each member reveals nothing about its secret.In another scenario, the secret is partitioned between distinct devices sharing the same identity. A group of cooperative users looks like a unique user having a larger public exponent which is the greater common multiple of each individual exponent.In this paper, additional features are introduced in order to provide: firstly, a mutual interactive authentication of both communicating entities and previously exchanged messages, and, secondly, a digital signature of messages, with a non-interactive zero-knowledge protocol. The problem of multiple signature is solved here in a very smart way due to the possibilities of cooperation between users.The only secret key is the factors of the composite number chosen by the authority delivering one authentication number to each smart card. This key is not known by the user. At the user level, such a scheme may be considered as a keyless identity-based integrity scheme. This integrity has anew and important property: it cannot be misused, i.e. derived into a confidentiality scheme.",

      "abstract": "The authors describe a secure teleconferencing system which can be operated in the public communications network. In this system, advantage is taken of the fact that clear speech must be available at each telephone set for the local participant, and this can be used with a distributed conference circuit to provide a multiparty conferencing system. The network conference control unit knows the addresses of all the participants but its role is limited to provided channel connections and demultiplexing and distributing unaltered signals from the participants. The conference unit does not need to know any security information. The system can operate with a number of security methods, and the users are free to select the techniques that they are most comfortable with. The system is suitable for implementation in digital networks such as the integrated service digital network, and can provide extremely high quality and robust operation. >",

      "abstract": "Dynamic data structure problems involve the representation of data in memory in such a way as to permit certain types of modifications of the data (updates) and certain types of questions about the data (queries). This paradigm encompasses many fundamental problems in computer science.\nThe purpose of this paper is to prove new lower and upper bounds on the time per operation to implement solutions to some familiar dynamic data structure problems including list representation, subset ranking, partial sums, and the set union problem. The main features of our lower bounds are:<list><item>They hold in the <italic>cell probe</italic> model of computation (A. Yao [18]) in which the time complexity of a sequential computation is defined to be the number of words of memory that are accessed. (The number of bits <italic>b</italic> in a single word of memory is a parameter of the model). All other computations are free. This model is at least as powerful as a random access machine and allows for unusual representation of data, indirect addressing etc. This contrasts with most previous lower bounds which are proved in models (e.g., algebraic, comparison, pointer manipulation) which require restrictions on the way data is represented and manipulated.\n</item><item>The lower bound method presented here can be used to derive amortized complexities, worst case per operation complexities, and randomized complexities.\n</item><item>The results occasionally provide (nearly tight) tradeoffs between the number <italic>R</italic> of words of memory that are read per operation, the number <italic>W</italic> of memory words rewritten per operation and the size <italic>b</italic> of each word. For the problems considered here there is a parameter <italic>n</italic> that represents the size of the data set being manipulated and for these problems <italic>b</italic> = log<italic>n</italic> is a natural register size to consider. By letting <italic>b</italic> vary, our results illustrate the effect of register size on time complexity. For instance, one consequence of the results is that for some of the problems considered here, increasing the register size from log<italic>n</italic> to polylog(<italic>n</italic>) only reduces the time complexity by a constant factor. On the other hand, decreasing the register size from log<italic>n</italic> to 1 increases time complexity by a log<italic>n</italic> factor for one of the problems we consider and only a loglog<italic>n</italic> factor for some other problems.\n</item></list>\nThe first two specific data structure problems for which we obtain bounds are:<list><item>List Representation. This problem concerns the representation of an ordered list of at most <italic>n</italic> (not necessarily distinct) elements from the universe <italic>U</italic> = {1, 2,…, <italic>n</italic>}. The operations to be supported are report(<italic>k</italic>), which returns the <italic>k<supscrpt>th</supscrpt></italic> element of the list, insert(<italic>k</italic>, <italic>u</italic>) which inserts element <italic>u</italic> into the list between the elements in positions <italic>k</italic> - 1 and <italic>k</italic>, delete(<italic>k</italic>), which deletes the <italic>k<supscrpt>th</supscrpt></italic> item.\n</item><item>Subset Rank. This problem concerns the representation of a subset <italic>S</italic> of <italic>U</italic> = {1, 2,…, <italic>n</italic>}. The operations that must be supported are the updates “insert item <italic>j</italic> into the set” and “delete item <italic>j</italic> from the set” and the queries rank(<italic>j</italic>), which returns the number of elements in <italic>S</italic> that are less than or equal to <italic>j</italic>.\n</item></list>\nThe natural word size for these problems is <italic>b</italic> = log<italic>n</italic>, which allows an item of <italic>U</italic> or an index into the list to be stored in one register. One simple solution to the list representation problem is to maintain a vector <italic>v</italic>, whose <italic>k<supscrpt>th</supscrpt></italic> entry contains the <italic>k<supscrpt>th</supscrpt></italic> item of the list. The report operation can be done in constant time, but the insert and delete operations may take time linear in the length of the list. Alternatively, one could store the items of the list with each element having a pointer to its predecessor and successor in the list. This allows for constant time updates (given a pointer to the appropriate location), but requires linear cost for queries.\nThis problem can be solved must more efficiently by use of balanced trees (such as AVL trees). When <italic>b</italic> = log<italic>n</italic>, the worst case cost per operation using AVL trees is <italic>O</italic>(log<italic>n</italic>). If instead <italic>b</italic> = 1, so that each bit access costs 1, then the AVL three solution requires <italic>O</italic>(log<supscrpt>2</supscrpt><italic>n</italic>) per operation.\nIt is not hard to find similar upper bounds for the subset rank problem (the algorithms for this problem are actually simpler than AVL trees).\nThe question is: are these upper bounds bet possible? Our results show that the upper bounds for the case of log<italic>n</italic> bit registers are within a loglog<italic>n</italic> factor of optimal. On the other hand, somewhat surprisingly, for the case of single bit registers there are implementations for both of these problems that run in time significantly faster than <italic>O</italic>(log<supscrpt>2</supscrpt><italic>n</italic>) per operation.\nLet CPROBE(<italic>b</italic>) denote the cell probe computational model with register size <italic>b</italic>.\nTheorem 1. If <italic>b</italic> ≤ (log<italic>n</italic>)<supscrpt><italic>t</italic></supscrpt> for some <italic>t</italic>, then any CPROBE(<italic>b</italic>) implementation of either list representation or the subset rank requires &OHgr;(log<italic>n</italic>/loglog<italic>n</italic>) amortized time per operation.\nTheorem 2. Subset rank and list representation have CPROBE(1) implementations with respective complexities <italic>O</italic>((log<italic>n</italic>)(loglog<italic>n</italic>)) and <italic>O</italic>((log<italic>n</italic>)(loglog<italic>n</italic>)<supscrpt>2</supscrpt>) per operation.\nPaul Dietz (personal communication) has found an implementation of list representation with log<italic>n</italic> bit registers that requires only <italic>O</italic>(log<italic>n</italic>/loglog<italic>n</italic>) time per operation, and thus the result of theorem 1 is best possible.\nThe lower bounds of theorem 1 are derived from lower bounds for a third problem:<list><item>Partial sum mode k. An array <italic>A</italic>[1],…, <italic>A</italic>[<italic>N</italic>] of integers mod <italic>k</italic> is to be represented. Updates are add(<italic>i</italic>, δ) which implements <italic>A</italic>[<italic>i</italic>] ← <italic>A</italic>[<italic>i</italic>] + δ; and queries are sum(j) which returns &Sgr;<subscrpt><italic>i</italic>≤<italic>j</italic></subscrpt><italic>A</italic>[<italic>i</italic>] (mod <italic>k</italic>).\n</item></list>\nThis problem is demoted PS(n, k). Our main lower bound theorems provide tradeoffs between the number of register rewrites and register reads as a function of <italic>n</italic>, <italic>k</italic>, and <italic>b</italic>. Two corollaries of these results are:<list><item>Theorem 3. Any CPROBE(<italic>b</italic>) implementation of PS(n, 2) (partial sums mod 2) requires &OHgr;(log<italic>n</italic>/(loglog<italic>n</italic> + log<italic>b</italic>)) amortized time per operation, and for <italic>b</italic> ≥ log<italic>n</italic>, there is an implementation that achieves this. In particular, if <italic>b</italic> = &THgr;((log<italic>n</italic>)<supscrpt>c</supscrpt>) for some constant <italic>c</italic>, then the optimal time complexity of PS(n, 2) is &thgr;(log<italic>n</italic>/loglog<italic>n</italic>).\n</item><item>Theorem 4. Any CPROBE(1) implementation of PS(n, n) with single bit registers requires &OHgr;((log<italic>n</italic>/loglog<italic>n</italic>)<supscrpt>2</supscrpt>) amortized time per operation, and there is an implementation that achieves <italic>O</italic>(log<supscrpt>2</supscrpt><italic>n</italic>) time per operation.\n</item></list>\nIt can be shown that a lower bound of PS(n, 2) is also a lower bound for both list representation and subset rank (the details, which are not difficult, are omitted from this report), and thus theorem 1 follows from theorem 3. The results of theorem 4 make an interesting contrast with those of theorem 2. For the three problems, list representation, subset rank and PS(n, k), there are standard algorithms that can be implemented on a CPROBE(log<italic>n</italic>) that use time <italic>O</italic>(log<italic>n</italic> per operation, and their implementations on CPROBE(1) require <italic>O</italic>(log<supscrpt>2</supscrpt><italic>n</italic>) time. Theorem 4 says that for the problem PS(n, n) this algorithm is essentially best possible, while theorem 2 says that for list representation and rank, the algorithm can be significantly improved. In fact, the rank problem an be viewed as a special case of PS(n, n) where the variables take on values on {0, 1}, and apparently this specialization is enough to reduce the complexity on a CPROBE(1) by a factor of log<italic>n</italic>/loglog<italic>n</italic>, even though on a CPROBE(log<italic>n</italic>) the complexities of the two problems differ by no more than a loglog<italic>n</italic> factor.\nThe third problem we consider is the set union problem. This problem concerns the design of a data structure for the on-line manipulation of sets in the following setting. Initially, there are <italic>n</italic> singleton sets {1}, {2},…, {<italic>n</italic>} with <italic>i</italic> chosen as the name of the set {<italic>i</italic>}. Our data structure is required to implement two operations, Find(<italic>j</italic>), and Union(<italic>A</ital",

For example, an oblivious Turing Machine is one for which the movement of the heads on the tapes is identical for each computation. (Thus, it is independent of the actual input.) What is the slowdown in the running time of any machine, if it is required to be oblivious? In 1979 Pippenger and Fischer [PF] showed how a twotape oblivious Turing Machine can simulate, on-line, a onetape Turing Machine, with a logarithmic slowdown in the running time. We show a similar result for the randomaccess machine (RAM) model of computation, solving an open problem posed by Goldreich [G]. In particular, we show how to do an on-line simulation of an arbitrary RAM program by a probabilistic RAM whose memory access pattern is independent of the program which is being executed, and with a poly-logarithmic slowdown in the running time. Our proof yields a technique of efficiently hiding (through randomization) the access pattern into any composite datastructure. As one of the applications, we exhibit a simple and efficient software protection scheme for a generic oneprocessor RAM model of computation.",

      "abstract": "Much research in theoretical cryptography has been centered around finding the weakest possible cryptographic assumptions required to implement major primitives. Ever since Diffie and Hellman first suggested that modern cryptography be based on one-way functions (which are easy to compute, but hard to invert) and trapdoor functions (one-way functions which are, however, easy to invert given an associated secret), researchers have been busy trying to construct schemes that only require one of these general assumptions. For example, pseudorandom generators at first could only be constructed from a specific hard problem, such as discrete log IBM2]. Later it was shown how to construct pseudo-random generators given any one-way permutation [Y], and from other weak forms of one-way functions [Le, GKL]. Finally JILL] proved that the existence of any one-way function was a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of pseudo-random generators. Similarly, the existence of trapdoor permutations can be shown to be necessary and sufficient for secure encryption schemes. However, progress on characterizing the requirements for secure digital signatures has been slower in coming. We will be interested in signature schemes which are secure agMnst existential forgery under adaptive chosen message attacks. This notion of security, as well as the first construction of digital signatures secure in this sense was provided by [GMR]. Their scheme was based on factoring, or more generally, the existence of clawfree pairs.

      "abstract": "Assume we have a network of three or more players, each player in possession of some private input. The players want to compute some function of these private inputs, but in a way which protects the privacy of each participant's contribution. Not all of the players can be trusted to do as they are instructed. The resources the players are given to accomplish their goal are communication--the ability to privately send messages to one another, or to broadcast messages to the community as a whole--and local computation. \nMany insightful protocols have been proposed for solving this problem of multiparty secure function evaluation. Building on Yao's protocol for the case of two players (Ya86), Goldreich, Micali and Wigderson (GMW87) offered the first general protocol for this problem, and they provided the paradigm on which a large body of successive work was based. \nDespite enormous progress, research on secure function evaluation has suffered from some serious shortcomings. First, though many protocols have been devised for solving the problem, what, exactly, these protocols accomplish has not been fully understood. In fact, no rigorously specified and generally accepted definitions have been proposed in this field. Second, protocols for multiparty secure function evaluation could be extremely inefficient, the main cause being that they required an unbounded (and usually large) number of communication rounds. \nWe address both of these points, carefully crafting definitions which satisfactorily deal with the myriad of issues lurking here, and offering a new protocol for multiparty secure function evaluation--one which categorically improves the complexity requirements for this task. The new protocol completely divorces the computational complexity of the function being collaboratively computed from the round complexity of the protocol that evaluates it. Using this approach, we show that a rigorously-specified and extremely strong notion of secure function evaluation can be achieved by a protocol which requires only a fixed constant number of rounds of interaction. This result assumes only the existence of a one-way function and that the majority of the participants to the protocol behave correctly.

Neither party can cheat (ie deviate from the protocol while appearing to follow it) in such a way as to obtain more information than what is given by the description of the protocol. Our protocol is easy to modify in order to implement the All-or-Nothing Disclosure of one out of two string messages, and it can be used to implement bit commitment and oblivious circuit evaluation without complexity-theoretic assumptions, in a way that remains secure even against cheaters that have unlimited computing power.

A secure protocol must mimic this abstraction in a run-by-run manner, our definition depending as much on individual executions as on global properties of ensembles. ? Blending privacy and correctness in a novel way, using a special type of simulator designed for the purpose. ?

Our results exploit recent advances in interactive proof protocols [LFKN], [Sh], and especially the MIP = NEXP protocol from [BFL]. WJe show that every nondeterministic computational task S(Z, y), defined as a polynomial time relation between the instance x, representing the input and output combined, and the witness y can be modified to a task S such that: (i) the same instances remain accepted; (ii) each instance/witness pair becomes checkable in poly!ogariihmic Monte Carlo time; and (iii) a witness satisfying S’ can be computed in polynomial time from a witness satisfying S. Here the instance and the description of S have to be provided in error-correcting code (since the checker will not notice slight changes). A modification of the MIP proof was required to achieve polynomial time in (iii); the earlier technique yields N“(*OglOg’1 time only. This result becomes significant if software and hardware reliability are regarded aa a considerable cost factor. The polylogarithmic checker is the only part of the system that needs to be trusted; it can be hard wired. (We use just one Checker for all problems!) The checker is tiny and so presumably can be optimized and checked off-line at a modest cost. In this setup, a single reliable PC can monitor the operation of a herd of supercomputers working with possibly extremely powerful but unreliable software and untested hardware. 1Research partially supported by NSF Grant CCR-871OO78.

These are probabilistic and interactive proofs that, for the members of a language, efficiently demonstrate membership in the language without conveying any additional knowledge. All previously known zero-knowledge proofs were only for number-theoretic languages in NP fl CONP. Under the assumption that secure encryption functions exist or by using \"physical means for hiding information, '' it is shown that all languages in NP have zero-knowledge proofs. Loosely speaking, it is possible to demonstrate that a CNF formula is satisfiable without revealing any other property of the formula, in particular, without yielding neither a satis@ing assignment nor properties such as whether there is a satisfying assignment in which xl = X3 etc. It is also demonstrated that zero-knowledge proofs exist \"outside the domain of cryptography and number theory. \" Using no assumptions. it is shown that both graph isomorphism and graph nonisomor- phism have zero-knowledge interactive proofs. The mere existence of an interactive proof for graph nonisomorphism is interesting, since graph nonisomorphism is not known to be in NP and hence no efficient proofs were known before for demonstrating that two graphs are not isomorphic.",

We show that the minimum achievable difference is on the order of the square root of the number of mistakes of the best expert, and we give efficient algorithms that achieve this. Our upper and lower bounds have matching leading constants in most cases. We then show how this leads to certain kinds of pattern recognition/learning algorithms with performance bounds that improve on the best results currently known in this context.

      "abstract": "We define the primitive of function sharing, a functional analog of secret sharing, and employ it to construct novel cryptosystems. The basic idea of function sharing is to split a hard to compute (trapdoor) function into shadow functions (or share-functions). The intractable function becomes easy to compute at a given point value when given any threshold (at least t out of i) of shadow functions evaluations at that point. Otherwise, the function remains hard. Furthermore, the function must remain intractable even after exposing up to t— 1 shadow functions and exposing values of all shadow functions at polynomially many inputs. The primitive enables the distribution of the power to perform cryptography (signature, decryption, etc.) to agents. This enables the design of various novel cryptosystems with improved integrity, availability and security properties. Our model should be contrasted with the model of secure function evaluation protocols. We require no channeIs between agents holding the shadow functions, as the agents act non-interactively on a publicly available input. Our security solely relies on secure memories (and results) as in regular cr yptosyst ems. In secure function evaluation, on the other hand, it is necessary to have private/ secured bilateral channels, interactive protocol, and security of all inputs – in addition to secure memories. *Dip. di Informatica ed Applicazioni Universit& di Salerno, Baronissi (SA), Italy. t Dept. of EE&CS, Univ. of Wisconsin Milwaukee, WI.

This simple defect enables vote buying and coercion which are impractical in current physical election systems due to the \" plausible deniability \" offered by a voting booth. This defect is embedded, not only within prior election protocols, but within all of the more general protocols for collective computation of a public function from private inputs. This paper presents the first verifiable secret-ballot election protocols in which participants are unable to prove to others how they voted. 1 Introduction In traditional elections, the voting booth does more thi~n allow voters to keep their votes private, it actually requires that votes stay secret. This may seem like a subtle distinction, but it is, in fact, an essential component of secret-ballot elections. If a voter is allowed, but not required, to keep a vote secret, the voter could be coerced by an employer or anyone with power over the voter into casting a certain vote. The cryptographic election schemes found in the literature all suffer from a common deficiency. While they may allow a voter to conceal a vote, they also allow a voter to carry away a receipt which can be used to prove to a third party that a particular vote was cast. While thki receipt may seem like a feature, it eliminates the ability of a voter to deceive others about its vote.

Most of previous work on communication complexity only considers the total number of bits sent, but we study trade-offs between the number of bits the first player sends and the number of bits the second sends. These types of questions are closely related to the complexity of static data structure problems in the cell probe model. We derive two generally applicable methods of proving lower bounds and obtain several applications. These applications include new lower bounds for data structures in the cell probe model. Of particular interest is our ``round elimination'' lemma, which is interesting also for the usual symmetric communication case. This lemma generalizes and abstracts in a very clean form the ``round reduction'' techniques used in many previous lower bound proofs. ] 1998 Academic Press",

Both are achieved by implementing a wait-free, atomic, single-writer multi-reader register in unreliable, asynchronous networks. The two message-passing models considered are a complete network with processor failures and an arbitrary network with dynamic link failures.\nThese results make it possible to view the shared-memory model as a higher-level language for designing algorithms in asynchronous distributed systems. Any wait-free algorithm based on atomic, single-writer multi-reader registers can be automatically emulated in message-passing systems, provided that at least a majority of the processors are not faulty and remain connected. The overhead introduced by these emulations is polynomial in the number of processors in the system.\nImmediate new results are obtained by applying the emulators to known shared-memory algorithms. These include, among others, protocols to solve the following problems in the message-passing model in the presence of processor or link failures: multi-writer multi-reader registers, concurrent time-stamp systems, l-exclusion, atomic snapshots, randomized consensus, and implementation of data structures.",

Many such proof systems, such as resolution, are rdso used as the basis for heuristics which deterministicrdly search for short proofs in the system. We discuss a propositional proof system baaed on algebraic rea soning, which we call the Groebner proof system because of a tight connection to the Groebner basis algorithm. For an appropriate measure of proof size, we show that (a degree-limited implement =ation of ) the Groebner basis algorithm finds a Groebner proof of a tautology in time polynomial in the size of the smallest such proof, In other words, urdike most proof systems, the non-deterministic algorithm can be converted to a deterministic one without loss in power. We then compare the power of the Groebner proof system to more studied systems. We show that the Groebner system polynomially simulates Horn clause resolution, quasi-polynomially simulates tree-like resolution, and weakly exponentially simulates resolution. Thus, Groebnerproofs will have better than worst-case behaviour on the same classes of inputs that resolution does. On the other hand, there are simple tautologies which have polynomialsize Groebner proofs but which require exponential-size resolution proofs. We also compare the Groebner proof system to the similar Nullstellensatz proof system introduced in [BIK+94]. We show a family of tautologies that have degree 3 (and hence polynomirdsize) Groebner refutations, but which require @(W degree Nullst ellensat z refutations.

      "abstract": "A fundamental problem in designing secure multi-party protocols is how to deal with adaptive adversaries (i.e., adversaries that may choose the corrupted parties during the course of the computation), in a setting where the channels are insecure and secure communication is achieved by cryptographic primitives based on computational limitations of the adversary. It turns out that the power of an adaptive adversary is greatly affected by the amount of information gathered upon the corruption of the party. This amount of information models the extent to which uncorrupted parties are trusted to carry out instructions that cannot be externally verified, such as erasing records of past configurations. It has been shown that if the parties are trusted to erase such records, then adaptivity secure computation can be carried out using known primitives. However, this total trust in parties may be unrealistic in many scenarios. An important question, open since 1986, is whether adaptively secure multi-party computation can be carried out in the \"insecure channel\" setting, even if no party is thoroughly trusted. Our main result is an affirmative resolution of this question for the case where even uncorrupted parties may deviate from the protocol by keeping record of all past configurations. We first propose a novel property of encryption protocols and show that if an encryption protocol enjoying this property is used, instead of a standard encryption scheme, then known constructions become adaptively secure. Next we constructed, based on standard RSA assumption, an encryption protocol that enjoys this property. We also consider parties that, even when corrupted, may internally deviate from their protocols in arbitrary ways, as long as no external test can detect faulty behavior. We show that in this case no non-trivial protocol can be proven adaptively secure using black-box simulation. This holds even if the communication channels are totally secure.",

Signing takes one RSA decryption plus some hashing, verification takes one RSA encryption plus some hashing, and the size of the signature is the size of the modulus. Assuming the underlying hash functions are ideal, our schemes are not only provably secure, but are so in a tight way-- an ability to forge signatures with a certain amount of computational resources implies the ability to invert RSA (on the same size modulus) with about the same computational effort. Furthermore, we provide a second scheme which maintains all of the above features and in addition provides message recovery. These ideas extend to provide schemes for Rabin signatures with analogous properties; in particular their security can be tightly related to the hardness of factoring.",

In a practical sense, it is essential for the signer to include some term of validity in the signing message to prevent abusing. Of course the term must not violate the confidentiality of the message. This paper discusses partial blinding of a signed message. We consider RSA and it is proved that forging the proposed scheme by multiple signing is as difficult as breaking RSA.

The current standard method to achieve this aim is “(digital) signature followed by encryption”. In this paper, we address a question on the cost of secure and authenticated message delivery/storage, namely, whether it is possible to transport/store messages of varying length in a secure and authenticated way with an expense less than that required by “signature followed by encryption”. This question seems to have never been addressed in the literature since the invention of public key cryptography. We then present a positive answer to the question. In particular, we discover a new cryptographic primitive termed as “signcryption” which simultaneously fulfills both the functions of digital signature and public key encryption in a logically single step, and with a cost significantly lower than that required by “signature followed by encryption”. For typical security parameters for high level security applications (size of public moduli = 1536 bits), signcryption costs 50% (31%, respectively) less in computation time and 85% (91%, respectively) less in message expansion than does “signature followed by encryption” based on the discrete logarithm problem (factorization problem, respectively).",

      "abstract": "We present a new efficient paradigm for signing digital streams. The problem of signing digital streams to prove their authenticity is substantially different from the problem of signing regular messages. Traditional signature schemes are message oriented and require the receiver to process the entire message before being able to authenticate its signature. However, a stream is a potentially very long (or infinite) sequence of bits that the sender sends to the receiver and the receiver is required to consumes the received bits at more or less the input rate and without excessive delay. Therefore it is infeasible for the receiver to obtain the entire stream before authenticating and consuming it. Examples of streams include digitized video and audio files, data feeds and applets. We present two solutions to the problem of authenticating digital streams. The first one is for the case of a finite stream which is entirely known to the sender (say a movie). We use this constraint to devise an extremely efficient solution. The second case is for a (potentially infinite) stream which is not known in advance to the sender (for example a live broadcast). We present proofs of security of our constructions. Our techniques also have applications in other areas, for example, efficient authentication of long files when communication is at a cost and signature based filtering at a proxy server.",

In this paper we show that, in non-uniform settings, total independence is not necessary for this result to hold. We give a pseudo-random generator which produces n instances of a problem for which the analog of the XOR lemma holds. Combining this generator with the results of [25, 6] gives substantially improved results for hardness vs randomness tradeoffs. In particular, we show that if any problem in E = DTIAl E(2°t”j) has circuit complexity 2Q(”), then P = BPP. Our generator is a combination of two known ones the random walks on expander graphs of [1, 10, 19] and the nearly disjoint subsets generator of [23, 25]. The quality of the generator is proved via a new proof of the XOR lemma which may be useful for other direct product results. *Research supported by NSF YI Award CCR-92s70979, Sloan Research Fellowship BR-3311, grant #93025 of the joint US-Czechoslovak Science and Technology Program, and USA-Israel BSF Grant 92-00043 tWork pmtly done while visiting the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, N.

      "abstract": "We introduce a new low-degree-test, one that uses the restriction of low-degree polynomials to planes (i. e., afine sub-spaces of dimension 2), rather than the restriction to lines (i. e., afine sub-spaces of dimension 1). We prove the new test to be of a very small emorprobability (in particular, much smaller than constant). The new test enables us to prove a low-error characterization of NP in terms of PCP. Specifically, OUT theorem states that, for any given c > 0, membership in any NP language can be verijied with 0(1) accesses, each r’eading logarithmic number of bits, and such that the error-probability is 2‘“~’-’ n. Our results are in fact stronger, as stated below. One application of the new characterization of NP is that approximating SETCOVER to within a logarithmic factors is NP-hard. Previous analysis for low-degree-tests, as well as previous characten”zations of NP in terms of PCP, have managed to achieve, with constant number of accesses, error-probability of, at best, a constant. The proof for the smail err-or-probability of our new low-degree-test is, nevertheless, significantly simpler than previous proofs. In particular, it is combinatorial and geometrical in nature, rather than algebraic. 1 Characterizations of NP in terms of PCP Characterizing the class NP, by itself or with respect to other computational-complexity clssses, is perhaps one *URL http: //www.math.tau. ac.il/school/courses/PCP tWejzmm ~st., ISRAEL. ~-a@wj~dom.wej--$ ac,J 1Tel-Aviv University, ISRAEL.

Since the early days, when the classes P and NP were defined, and the question was posed as to whether they are the same or do they differ, many problems were shown to be NP-complete, thereby increasing the weight on finding stricter characterization for the class NP. NP has since been given a few alternative characterizations. The one most commonly applied being Cook’s [CO071], which characterizes NP in terms of efficient verification of proofs (or nondeterministic computations). A new perspective, by which improved characterizations of NP can be obtained, has been recently proposed. The motivation for which stems from questions regarding the hardness of approximation versions, for problems whose exact computation is known to be NP-hard. This avenue of research was initiated by [FGL+91], which introduced a new methodology for proving hardness results for approximation problems. The method takes advantage of results in a seemingly unrelated area — that of interactive proofs [GMR89, Bab85, BGKW88, LFKN92, Sha92, BFL91] — however interprets those results with quite a different perspective in mind. Much effort has been invested since towards a better understanding of this methodology, and the class NP has consequently gained stricter characterizations [AS92, ALM+92, BGS95], which are referred to as characterizations of NP in terms of PCP (or, in short, PCP characterizations of NP). The PCP characterization of NP — though has taken around 20 years to be formulated — seems now as the most natural extension of the old characterization of NP [CO071], if one has in mind proving hardness results for approximation problems. This characterization has already been used to obtain quite a few hardness results for approximation problems [FGL+91, AS92, ALM+ 92, PY91, LY94, BGLR93, KLS93, BGS95, Hiis96a, H5a96b, H5s97]. The previous characterization of NP in terms of the PCP hierarchy [AS92, ALM+ 92], seemed at first ss the best possible up to constant factors. A stronger characterization was later conjectured in [BGLR93]; one that, as an outcome, implies NP-hardness of approximating SET-COVER to within logarithmic factors [LY94, BGLR93].

      "abstract": "In the past year many developments have taken place in the area of quantum error corrections. Recently Shor showed how to perform fault tolerant quantum computation when, ~, the probability for a fault in one time step per qubit or per gate, is polylogarithmically small. This paper closes the gap and shows how to perform fault tolerant quantum computation when the error probability, q, is smaller than some constant threshold, q.. The cost is polylogarithmic in time and space, and no measurements are used during the quantum computation. The same result is shown also for quantum circuits which operate on nearest neighbors only. To achieve this noise resistance, we use concatenated quantum error correcting codes. The scheme presented is general, and works with any quantum code, that satisfies certain restm”ctions, namely that it is a “proper quantum code”. The constant threshold r10 is a function of the parameters of the specifc proper code used. We present two explicit classes of proper quantum codes. The first class generalizes classical secret sharing with polynomials. The codes are defined over a field with p elements, which means that the elementary quantum particle is not a qubit but a “qupit”. The second class uses a known class of quantum codes and converts it to a proper code. We estimate the threshold qO to be = 10-6. Hopefully, this paper motivates a search for proper quantum codes with higher thresholds, at which point quantum computation becomes practical.",

In Crypto`95, T. Okamoto presented the first practical divisible, untraceable, off-line e-cash scheme, which requires only O(log N) computations for each of the withdrawal, payment and deposit procedures, where N = (total coin value)/(smallest divisible unit). However, Okamoto`s set-up procedure is quite inefficient (on the order of 4,000 multi-exponentiations and depending on the size of the RSA modulus). The authors formalize the notion of range-bounded commitment, originally used in Okamoto`s account establishment protocol, and present a very efficient instantiation which allows one to construct the first truly efficient divisible e-cash system. The scheme only requires the equivalent of one (1) exponentiation for set-up, less than 2 exponentiations for withdrawal and around 20 for payment, while the size of the coin remains about 300 Bytes. Hence, the withdrawal protocol is 3 orders of magnitude faster than Okamoto`s, while the rest of the system remains equally efficient, allowing for implementation in smart-cards. Similar to Okamoto`s, the scheme is based on proofs whose cryptographic security assumptions are theoretically clarified.",

We give a definition of protocol divertibility that applies to arbitrary 2-party protocols and is compatible with Okamoto and Ohta's definition in the case of interactive zero-knowledge proofs. Other important examples falling under the new definition are blind signature protocols. We propose a sufficiency criterion for divertibility that is satisfied by many existing protocols and which, surprisingly, generalizes to cover several protocols not normally associated with divertibility (e.g., Diffie-Hellman key exchange). Next, we introduce atomic proxy cryptography, in which an atomic proxy function, in conjunction with a public proxy key, converts ciphertexts (messages or signatures) for one key into ciphertexts for another. Proxy keys, once generated, may be made public and proxy functions applied in untrusted environments. We present atomic proxy functions for discrete-log-based encryption, identification, and signature schemes.

These protocols, combined with (old and new) classical lower bounds, are shown to provide the first asymptotic separation results between the quantum and classical (probabilistic) two-party communication complexity models. In particular, we obtain a quadratic separation for the bounded-error model, and an exponential separation for the zero-error model. The negative results transform known quantum communication lower bounds to computational lower bounds in the black-box model. In particular, we show that the quadratic speed-up achieved by Grover for the OR function is impossible for the PARITY function or the MAJORITY function in the bounded-error model, nor is it possible for the OR function itself in the exact case. This dichotomy naturally suggests a study of bounded-depth predicates (i.e. those in the polynomial hierarchy) between OR and MAJORITY.

This result can be viewed as a partial justification for the common practice of treating the collision-intractable hash function as a cryptographic primitive, rather than attempting to derive it from a weaker primitive (such as a one-way permutation).",

We show that, with respect to these definitions, security is preserved under a natural composition operation. The definitions follow the general paradigm of known definitions; yet some substantial modifications and simplifications are introduced. The composition operation is the natural ``subroutine substitution'' operation, formalized by Micali and Rogaway. We consider several standard settings for multiparty protocols, including the cases of eavesdropping, Byzantine, nonadaptive and adaptive adversaries, as well as the information-theoretic and the computational models. In particular, in the computational model we provide the first definition of security of protocols that is shown to be preserved under composition.",

The new protocol resists dictionary attacks mounted by either passive or active network intruders, allowing, in principle, even weak passphrases to be used safely. It also o ers perfect forward secrecy, which protects past sessions and passwords against future compromises. Finally, user passwords are stored in a form that is not plaintext-equivalent to the password itself, so an attacker who captures the password database cannot use it directly to compromise security and gain immediate access to the host. This new protocol combines techniques of zero-knowledge proofs with asymmetric key exchange protocols and o ers signi cantly improved performance over comparably strong extended methods that resist stolen-veri er attacks such as Augmented EKE or B-SPEKE.",

They all follow from width lower bounds, and we show how these follow from natural expansion property of clauses of the input tautology.\nIn the other direction, the width-size relations naturally suggest a simple dynamic programming procedure for automated theorem proving—one which simply searches for small width proofs. This relation guarantees that the runnuing time (and thus the size of the produced proof) is at most quasi-polynomial in the smallest tree-like proof.

This is an essential property for maintaining security of cryptographic protocols in complex and unpredictable environments such as the Internet. In particular, universally composable definitions guarantee security even when an unbounded number of protocol instances are executed concurrently in an adversarially controlled manner, they guarantee non-malleability with respect to arbitrary protocols, and more. We show how to formulate universally composable definitions of security for practically any cryptographic task. Furthermore, we demonstrate that practically any such definition can be realized using known techniques, as long as only a minority of the participants are corrupted. We then proceed to formulate universally composable definitions of a wide array of cryptographic tasks, including authenticated and secure communication, key-exchange, public-key encryption, signature, commitment, oblivious transfer, zero knowledge and more.

In our model, two parties owning confidential databases wish to run a data mining algorithm on the union of their databases, without revealing any unnecessary information. This problem has many practical and important applications, such as in medical research with confidential patient records. \n \nData mining algorithms are usually complex, especially as the size of the input is measured in megabytes, if not gigabytes. A generic secure multi-party computation solution, based on evaluation of a circuit computing the algorithm on the entire input, is therefore of no practical use. We focus on the problem of decision tree learning and use ID3, a popular and widely used algorithm for this problem. We present a solution that is considerably more efficient than generic solutions. It demands very few rounds of communication and reasonable bandwidth. In our solution, each party performs by itself a computation of the same order as computing the ID3 algorithm for its own database. The results are then combined using efficient cryptographic protocols, whose overhead is only logarithmic in the number of transactions in the databases. We feel that our result is a substantial contribution, demonstrating that secure multi-party computation can be made practical, even for complex problems and large inputs.",

      "abstract": "Abstract. The goal of secure multiparty computation is to transform a given protocol involving a trusted party into a protocol without need for the trusted party, by simulating the party among the players. Indeed, by the same means, one can simulate an arbitrary player in any given protocol. We formally define what it means to simulate a player by a multiparty protocol among a set of (new) players, and we derive the resilience of the new protocol as a function of the resiliences of the original protocol and the protocol used for the simulation. In contrast to all previous protocols that specify the tolerable adversaries by the number of corruptible players (a threshold), we consider general adversaries characterized by an adversary structure, a set of subsets of the player set, where the adversary may corrupt the players of one set in the structure. Recursively applying the simulation technique to standard threshold multiparty protocols results in protocols secure against general adversaries. The classical results in unconditional multiparty computation among a set of n players state that, in the passive model, any adversary that corrupts less than n/2 players can be tolerated, and in the active model, any adversary that corrupts less than n/3 players can be tolerated. Strictly generalizing these results we prove that, in the passive model, every function (more generally, every cooperation specified by involving a trusted party) can be computed securely with respect to a given adversary structure if and only if no two sets in the adversary structure cover the full set of players, and, in the active model, if and only if no three sets cover the full set of players. The complexities of the protocols are polynomial in the number of maximal adverse player sets in the adversary structure.",

Both proposed schemes use ?(k) bits to commit to one bit and can be based on the existence of trapdoor commitments and non-malleable encryption.We present new universally composable commitment (UCC) schemes based on extractable q one-way homomorphisms. These in turn exist based on the Paillier cryptosystem, the Okamoto-Uchiyama cryptosystem, or the DDH assumption. The schemes are efficient: to commit to k bits, they use a constant number of modular exponentiations and communicates O(k) bits. Furthermore the scheme can be instantiated in either perfectly hiding or perfectly binding versions. These are the first schemes to show that constant expansion factor, perfect hiding, and perfect binding can be obtained for universally composable commitments.We also show how the schemes can be applied to do efficient zero-knowledge proofs of knowledge that are universally composable.",

      "abstract": "We consider the question of protecting the privacy of customers buying digital goods. More specifically, our goal is to allow a buyer to purchase digital goods from a vendor without letting the vendor learn what, and to the extent possible also when and how much, it is buying. We propose solutions which allow the buyer, after making an initial deposit, to engage in an unlimited number of priced oblivious-transfer protocols, satisfying the following requirements: As long as the buyer's balance contains sufficient funds, it will successfully retrieve the selected item and its balance will be debited by the item's price. However, the buyer should be unable to retrieve an item whose cost exceeds its remaining balance. The vendor should learn nothing except what must inevitably be learned, namely, the amount of interaction and the initial deposit amount (which imply upper bounds on the quantity and total price of all information obtained by the buyer). In particular, the vendor should be unable to learn what the buyer's current balance is or when it actually runs out of its funds. \n \nThe technical tools we develop, in the process of solving this problem, seem to be of independent interest. In particular, we present the first one-round (two-pass) protocol for oblivious transfer that does not rely on the random oracle model (a very similar protocol was independently proposed by Naor and Pinkas [21]). This protocol is a special case of a more general \"conditional disclosure\" methodology, which extends a previous approach from [11] and adapts it to the 2-party setting.",

The problem becomes more complex in common settings where other receivers of the data are not trusted, and where lost packets are not retransmitted. Several source authentication schemes for multicast have been suggested in the past, but none of these schemes is satisfactorily efficient in all prominent parameters. We recently proposed a very efficient scheme, TESLA, that is based on initial loose time synchronization between the sender and the receivers, followed by delayed release of keys by the sender. This paper proposes several substantial modifications and improvements to TESLA. One modification allows receivers to authenticate most packets as soon as they arrive (whereas TESLArequires buffering packets at the receiver side, and provides delayed authentication only). Other modifications improve the scalability of the scheme, reduce the space overhead for multiple instances, increase its resistance to denial-of-service attacks, and more.",

      "abstract": "The dynamic behavior of a network in which information is changing continuously over time requires robust and efficient mechanisms for keeping nodes updated about new information. Gossip protocols are mechanisms for this task in which nodes communicate with one another according to some underlying deterministic or randomized algorithm, exchanging information in each communication step. In a variety of contexts, the use of randomization to propagate information has been found to provide better reliability and scalability than more regimented deterministic approaches.\nIn many settings --- consider a network of sensors, or a cluster of distributed computing hosts --- new information is generated at individual nodes, and is most “interesting” to nodes that are nearby. Thus, we propose distance-based propagation bounds as a performance measure for gossip algorithms: a node at distance d from the origin of a new piece of information should be able to learn about this information with a delay that grows slowly with d, and is independent of the size of the network.\nFor nodes arranged with uniform density in Euclidean space, we present natural gossip algorithms that satisfy such a guarantee: new information is spread to nodes at distance \\DIST, with high probability, in O(\\log^{1 + \\ve} \\DIST) time steps. Such a bound combines the desirable qualitative features of uniform gossip, in which information is spread with a delay that is logarithmic in the full network size, and deterministic flooding, in which information is spread with a delay that is linear in the distance and independent of the network size. Our algorithms and their analysis resolve a conjecture of Demers et al. We show an application of our gossip algorithms to a basic resource location problem, in which nodes seek to rapidly",

For example, NIZK plays a central role in building provably secure public-key cryptosystems based on general complexity-theoretic assumptions that achieve security against chosen ciphertext attacks. In essence, in a multi-party setting, given a fixed common random string of polynomial size which is visible to all parties, NIZK allows an arbitrary polynomial number of Provers to send messages to polynomially many Verifiers, where each message constitutes an NIZK proof for an arbitrary polynomial-size NP statement. \n \nIn this paper, we take a closer look at NIZK in the multi-party setting. First, we consider non-malleable NIZK, and generalizing and substantially strengthening the results of Sahai, we give the first construction of NIZK which remains non-malleable after polynomially-many NIZK proofs. Second, we turn to the definition of standard NIZK itself, and propose a strengthening of it. In particular, one of the concerns in the technical definition of NIZK (as well as non-malleable NIZK) is that the so-called \"simulator\" of the Zero-Knowledge property is allowed to pick a different \"common random string\" from the one that Provers must actually use to prove NIZK statements in real executions. In this paper, we propose a new definition for NIZK that eliminates this shortcoming, and where Provers and the simulator use the same common random string. Furthermore, we show that both standard and non-malleable NIZK (as well as NIZK Proofs of Knowledge) can be constructed achieving this stronger definition. We call such NIZK Robust NIZK and show how to achieve it. Our results also yields the simplest known public-key encryption scheme based on general assumptions secure against adaptive chosen-ciphertext attack (CCA2).",

It asks that an eavesdropper in possession of a ciphertext not be able to tell which specific key, out of a set of known public keys, is the one under which the ciphertext was created, meaning the receiver is anonymous from the point of view of the adversary. We investigate the anonymity of known encryption schemes. We prove that the El Gamal scheme provides anonymity under chosen-plaintext attack assuming the Decision Diffie-Hellman problem is hard and that the Cramer-Shoup scheme provides anonymity under chosen-ciphertext attack under the same assumption. We also consider anonymity for trapdoor permutations. Known attacks indicate that the RSA trapdoor permutation is not anonymous and neither are the standard encryption schemes based on it. We provide a variant of RSA-OAEP that provides anonymity in the random oracle model assuming RSA is one-way. We also give constructions of anonymous trapdoor permutations, assuming RSA is one-way, which yield anonymous encryption schemes in the standard model.",

We show that any secure channels protocol designed to work with any combination of secure encryption (against chosen plaintext attacks) and secure MAC must use the encrypt-then-authenticate method. We demonstrate this by showing that the other common methods of composing encryption and authentication, including the authenticate-then-encrypt method used in SSL, are not generically secure. We show an example of an encryption function that provides (Shannon's) perfect secrecy but when combined with any MAC function under the authenticate-then-encrypt method yields a totally insecure protocol (for example, finding passwords or credit card numbers transmitted under the protection of such protocol becomes an easy task for an active attacker). The same applies to the encrypt-and-authenticate method used in SSH. \n \nOn the positive side we show that the authenticate-then-encrypt method is secure if the encryption method in use is either CBC mode (with an underlying secure block cipher) or a stream cipher (that xor the data with a random or pseudorandom pad). Thus, while we show the generic security of SSL to be broken, the current practical implementations of the protocol that use the above modes of encryption are safe.",

      "abstract": "Recently, Canetti and Krawczyk (Eurocrypt'2001) formulated a notion of security for key-exchange (ke) protocols, called SK-security, and showed that this notion suffices for constructing secure channels. However, their model and proofs do not suffice for proving more general composability properties of SK-secure ke protocols.We show that while the notion of SK-security is strictly weaker than a fully-idealized notion of key exchange security, it is sufficiently robust for providing secure composition with arbitrary protocols. In particular, SK-security guarantees the security of the key for any application that desires to set-up secret keys between pairs of parties. We also provide new definitions of secure-channels protocols with similarly strong composability properties, and show that SK-security suffices for obtaining these definitions.To obtain these results we use the recently proposed framework of \"universally composable (UC) security.\" We also use a new tool, called \"noninformation oracles,\" which will probably find applications beyond the present case. These tools allow us to bridge between seemingly limited indistinguishability-based definitions such as SK-security and more powerful, simulation-based definitions, such as UC security, where general composition theorems can be proven. Furthermore, based on such composition theorems we reduce the analysis of a full-fledged multi-session keyexchange protocol to the (simpler) analysis of individual, stand-alone, key-exchange sessions.",

Also, the job's service demand is not known a priori. We are particularly concerned with the case where the workload is heavy-tailed, as is characteristic of many empirically measured computer workloads. We analyze several natural task assignment policies and propose a new one TAGS (Task Assignment based on Guessing Size). The TAGS algorithm is counterintuitive in many respects, including load unbalancing, non-work-conserving, and fairness. We find that under heavy-tailed workloads, TAGS can outperform all task assignment policies known to us by several orders of magnitude with respect to both mean response time and mean slowdown, provided the system load is not too high. We also introduce a new practical performance metric for distributed servers called server expansion. Under the server expansion metric, TAGS significantly outperforms all other task assignment policies, regardless of system load.",

      "abstract": "Broadcast Encryption schemes enable a center to broadcast encrypted programs so that only designated subsets of users can decrypt each program. The stateless variant of this problem provides each user with a fixed set of keys which is never updated. The best scheme published so far for this problem is the \"subset difference\" (SD) technique of Naor Naor and Lotspiech, in which each one of the n users is initially given O(log2(n)) symmetric encryption keys. This allows the broadcaster to define at a later stage any subset of up to r users as \"revoked\", and to make the program accessible only to their complement by sending O(r) short messages before the encrypted program, and asking each user to perform an O(log(n)) computation. In this paper we describe the \"Layered Subset Difference\" (LSD) technique, which achieves the same goal with O(log1+?(n)) keys, O(r) messages, and O(log(n)) computation. This reduces the number of keys given to each user by almost a square root factor without affecting the other parameters. In addition, we show how to use the same LSD keys in order to address any subset defined by a nested combination of inclusion and exclusion conditions with a number of messages which is proportional to the complexity of the description rather than to the size of the subset. The LSD scheme is truly practical, and makes it possible to broadcast an unlimited number of programs to 256,000,000 possible customers by giving each new customer a smart card with one kilobyte of tamper-resistant memory. It is then possible to address any subset defined by t nested inclusion and exclusion conditions by sending less than 4t short messages, and the scheme remains secure even if all the other users form an adversarial coalition.",

      "abstract": "Broadcast authentication is a fundamental security service in distributed sensor networks. A scheme named $\\mu$TESLA has been proposed for efficient broadcast authentication in such networks. However, $\\mu$TESLA requires initial distribution of certain information based on unicast between the base station and each sensor node before the actual authentication of broadcast messages. Due to the limited bandwidth in wireless sensor networks, this initial unicast-based distribution severely limits the application of $\\mu$TESLA in large sensor networks. This paper presents a novel technique to replace the unicast-based initialization with a broadcast-based one. As a result, $\\mu$TESLA can be used in a sensor network with a large amount of sensors, as long as the message from the base station can reach these sensor nodes. This paper further explores several techniques that improve the performance, the robustness, as well as the security of the proposed method. The resulting protocol satisfies several nice properties, including low overhead, tolerance of message loss, scalability to large networks, and resistance to replay attacks as well as some known Denial of Service (DOS) attacks.",

These works resulted in monotonicity testers whose query complexity is at most polylogarithmic in the size of the domain.We show that in its most general setting, testing that Boolean functions are close to monotone is equivalent, with respect to the number of required queries, to several other testing problems in logic and graph theory. These problems include: testing that a Boolean assignment of variables is close to an assignment that satisfies a specific 2-CNF formula, testing that a set of vertices is close to one that is a vertex cover of a specific graph, and testing that a set of vertices is close to a clique.We then investigate the query complexity of monotonicity testing of both Boolean and integer functions over general partial orders. We give algorithms and lower bounds for the general problem, as well as for some interesting special cases. In proving a general lower bound, we construct graphs with combinatorial properties that may be of independent interest.",

      "abstract": "This paper proposes a designated verifier signature scheme based on the Schnorr signature and the Zheng signcryption schemes. One of the advantages of the new scheme compared with all previously proposed schemes is that it achieves the “strong designated verifier” property without encrypting any part of the signatures. This is because the designated verifier’s secret key is involved in the verification phase. Another advantage of the proposed scheme is the low communication and computational cost. Generating a signature requires only one modular exponentiation, while this amount is two for the verification. Also, a signature in our scheme is more than four times shorter than those of known designated verifier schemes.",

The embedding process creates a stego medium by replacing these redundant bits with data from the hidden message.

We refer to this mechanism as Public Key Encryption with keyword Search. As another example, consider a mail server that stores various messages publicly encrypted for Alice by others. Using our mechanism Alice can send the mail server a key that will enable the server to identify all messages containing some specific keyword, but learn nothing else.

      "abstract": "Recently some efforts were made towards capturing the security requirements from digital signature schemes as an ideal functionality within a composable security framework. This modeling of digital signatures potentially has some significant analytical advantages (such as enabling component-wise analysis of complex systems that use signature schemes, as well as symbolic and automatable analysis of such systems). However, it turns out that formulating ideal functionalities that capture the properties expected from signature schemes in a way that is both sound and enjoys the above advantages is not a trivial task. This work has several contributions. We first correct some flaws in the definition of the ideal signature functionality of Canetti, 2001, and subsequent formulations. Next we provide a minimal formalization of \"ideal certification authorities\" and show how authenticated communication can be obtained using ideal signatures and an ideal certification authority. This is done while guaranteeing full modularity (i.e., each component is analyzed as stand-alone), and in an unconditional and errorless way. This opens the door to symbolic and automated analysis of protocols for these tasks, in a way that is both modular and cryptographically sound.",

A number of constructions of forward-secure digital signature schemes, key-exchange protocols, and symmetric-key schemes are known. \n \nWe present the first constructions of a (non-interactive) forward-secure public-key encryption scheme.

We consider the problem of protecting privacy in circuits, when faced with an adversary that can access a bounded number of wires in the circuit. This question is motivated by side channel attacks, which allow an adversary to gain partial access to the inner workings of hardware. Recent work has shown that side channel attacks pose a serious threat to cryptosystems implemented in embedded devices. In this paper, we develop theoretical foundations for security against side channels. In particular, we propose several efficient techniques for building private circuits resisting this type of attacks.

In this paper, we formalize a notion of security for proxy signature schemes and present provably-secure schemes.

We then show that employment of aggregate signature schemes permits bandwidth savings.

In particular, a protocol proven secure in this framework is guaranteed to maintain its security even when deployed in arbitrary multi-party, multi-protocol, multi-execution environments. Protocols for securely carrying out essentially any cryptographic task in a universally composable way exist, both in the case of an honest majority (in the plain model, i.e., without set-up assumptions) and in the case of no honest majority (in the common reference string model). However, in the plain model, little was known for the case of no honest majority and, in particular, for the important special case of two-party protocols. \n \nWe study the feasibility of universally composable two-party function evaluation in the plain model. Our results show that very few functions can be computed in this model so as to provide the UC security guarantees. Specifically, for the case of deterministic functions, we provide a full characterization of the functions computable in this model. (Essentially, these are the functions that depend on at most one of the parties' inputs, and furthermore are \"efficiently invertible\" in a sense defined within.) For the case of probabilistic functions, we show that the only functions computable in this model are those where one of the parties can essentially uniquely determine the joint output.",

      "abstract": "Minimal delay routing is a fundamental task in networks. Since delays depend on the (potentially unpredictable) traffic distribution, online delay optimization can be quite challenging. While uncertainty about the current network delays may make the current routing choices sub-optimal, the algorithm can nevertheless try to learn the traffic patterns and keep adapting its choice of routing paths so as to perform nearly as well as the best static path. This online shortest path problem is a special case of online linear optimization, a problem in which an online algorithm must choose, in each round, a strategy from some compact set S ⊆ Rd so as to try to minimize a linear cost function which is only revealed at the end of the round. Kalai and Vempala[4] gave an algorithm for such problems in the transparent feedback model, where the entire cost function is revealed at the end of the round. Here we present an algorithm for online linear optimization in the more challenging opaque feedback model, in which only the cost of the chosen strategy is revealed at the end of the round. In the special case of shortest paths, opaque feedback corresponds to the notion that in each round the algorithm learns only the end-to-end cost of the chosen path, not the cost of every edge in the network.We also present a second algorithm for online shortest paths, which solves the shortest-path problem using a chain of online decision oracles, one at each node of the graph. This has several advantages over the online linear optimization approach. First, it is effective against an adaptive adversary, whereas our linear optimization algorithm assumes an oblivious adversary. Second, even in the case of an oblivious adversary, the second algorithm performs better than the first, as measured by their additive regret.",

Traceable signatures support an extended set of fairness mechanisms (mec hanisms for anonymity management and revocation) when compared with the traditional group si gnature mechanism. We demonstrate that this extended function is needed for proper operation a nd adequate level of privacy in various settings and applications. For example, the new notion allo ws (distributed) tracing of all signatures by a single (misbehaving) party without opening signatures and revealing identities of any other user in the system. In contrast, if such tracing is implement ed by a state of the art group signature system, such wide opening of all signatures of a single user i s a (centralized) operation that requires the opening ofall anonymous signatures and revealing the users associated wi th them, an act that violates the privacy of all users. Our work includes a novel modeling of security in privacy sys tems that leads to simulationbased proofs. Security notions in privacy systems are typic ally more complex than the traditional security of cryptographic systems, thus our modeling metho dology may find future applications in other settings. To allow efficient implementation of our s cheme we develop a number of basic tools, zero-knowledge proofs, protocols, and primitives t hat we use extensively throughout.

In contrast to prior VRF constructions [14,15], it avoids using an inefficient Goldreich-Levin transformation, thereby saving several factors in security. Our proofs of security are based on a decisional bilinear Diffie-Hellman inversion assumption, which seems reasonable given current state of knowledge. For small message spaces, our VRF's proofs and keys have constant size. By utilizing a collision-resistant hash function, our VRF can also be used with arbitrary message spaces. We show that our scheme can be instantiated with an elliptic group of very reasonable size. Furthermore, it can be made distributed and proactive.",

Program obfuscation, if possible, would have numerous important cryp- tographic applications, including: (1) \"Intellectual property\" protection of secret algorithms and keys in software, (2) Solving the long-standing open problem of homomorphic public-key encryption, (3) Controlled delegation of authority and access, (4) Transforming Private-Key Encryption into Public-Key Encryption, and (5) Access Control Systems. Unfortunately however, program obfuscators that work on arbitrary programs cannot exist (1). No positive results for program obfuscation were known prior to this work. In this paper, we provide the first positive results in program obfuscation. We focus on the goal of access control, and give several provable obfuscations for complex access control functionalities, in the random oracle model. Our results are obtained through non-trivial compositions of obfuscations; we note that gen- eral composition of obfuscations is impossible, and so developing techniques for composing obfuscations is an important goal. Our work can also be seen as mak- ing initial progress toward the goal of obfuscating finite automata or regular ex- pressions, an important general class of machines which are not ruled out by the impossibility results of (1). We also note that our work provides the first formal proof techniques for obfuscation, which we expect to be useful in future work in this area.",

In order to retrieve documents satisfying a certain search criterion, the user gives the server a capability that allows the server to identify exactly those documents. Work in this area has largely focused on search criteria consisting of a single keyword. If the user is actually interested in documents containing each of several keywords (conjunctive keyword search) the user must either give the server capabilities for each of the keywords individually and rely on an intersection calculation (by either the server or the user) to determine the correct set of documents, or alternatively, the user may store additional information on the server to facilitate such searches. Neither solution is desirable; the former enables the server to learn which documents match each individual keyword of the conjunctive search and the latter results in exponential storage if the user allows for searches on every set of keywords.",

The method allows to express security properties and carry out proofs using a simple logic based language, where messages are represented by syntactic expressions, and does not require dealing with probability distributions or asymptotic notation explicitly. Still, we show that the method is sound, meaning that logic statements can be naturally interpreted in the computational setting in such a way that if a statement holds true for any abstract (symbolic) execution of the protocol in the presence of a Dolev-Yao adversary, then its computational interpretation is also correct in the standard computational model where the adversary is an arbitrary probabilistic polynomial time program. This is the first paper providing a simple framework for translating security proofs from the logic setting to the standard computational setting for the case of powerful active adversaries that have total control of the communication network.",

      "abstract": "Sharing data between widely distributed intrusion detection systems offers the possibility of significant improvements in speed and accuracy over isolated systems. In this paper, we describe and evaluate DOMINO (Distributed Overlay for Monitoring InterNet Outbreaks); an architecture for a distributed intrusion detection system that fosters collaboration among heterogeneous nodes organized as an overlay network. The overlay design enables DOMINO to be heterogeneous, scalable, and robust to attacks and failures. An important component of DOMINO’s design is the use of active-sink nodes which respond to and measure connections to unused IP addresses. This enables efficient detection of attacks from spoofed IP sources, reduces false positives, enables attack classification and production of timely blacklists. We evaluate the capabilities and performance of DOMINO using a large set of intrusion logs collected from over 1600 providers across the Internet. Our analysis demonstrates the significant marginal benefit obtained from distributed intrusion data sources coordinated through a system like DOMINO. We also evaluate how to configure DOMINO in order to maximize performance gains from the perspectives of blacklist length, blacklist freshness and IP proximity. We perform a retrospective analysis on the 2002 SQL-Snake and 2003 SQL-Slammer epidemics that highlights how information exchange through DOMINO would have reduced the reaction time and false-alarm rates during outbreaks. Finally, we provide preliminary results from our prototype active-sink deployment that illustrates the limited variability in the sink traffic and the feasibility of efficient classification and discrimination of attack types. ∗The U.S. Government is authorized to reproduce and distribute reprints for Governmental purposes, notwithstanding any copyright notices affixed thereon.

This scheme was adopted by the Trusted Computing Group (TCG) as the method for remote authentication of a hardware module, called Trusted Platform Module (TPM), while preserving the privacy of the user of the platform that contains the module. DAA can be seen as a group signature without the feature that a signature can be opened, i.e., the anonymity is not revocable. Moreover, DAA allows for pseudonyms, i.e., for each signature a user (in agreement with the recipient of the signature) can decide whether or not the signature should be linkable to another signature. DAA furthermore allows for detection of \"known\" keys: if the DAA secret keys are extracted from a TPM and published, a verifier can detect that a signature was produced using these secret keys. The scheme is provably secure in the random oracle model under the strong RSA and the decisional Diffie-Hellman assumption.",

Our results bolster the thesis of Liskov, Rivest, and Wagner [10] that a desirable approach for designing modes of operation is to start from a tweakable blockcipher.

      "abstract": "We consider the problem of threshold secret sharing in groups with hierarchical structure. In such settings, the secret is shared among a group of participants that is partitioned into levels. The access structure is then determined by a sequence of threshold requirements: a subset of participants is authorized if it has at least k 0 members from the highest level, as well as at least k 1 > k 0 members from the two highest levels and so forth. Such problems may occur in settings where the participants differ in their authority or level of confidence and the presence of higher level participants is imperative to allow the recovery of the common secret. Even though secret sharing in hierarchical groups has been studied extensively in the past, none of the existing solutions addresses the simple setting where, say, a bank transfer should be signed by three employees, at least one of whom must be a department manager. We present a perfect secret sharing scheme for this problem that, unlike most secret sharing schemes that are suitable for hierarchical structures, is ideal. As in Shamir’s scheme, the secret is represented as the free coefficient of some polynomial. The novelty of our scheme is the usage of polynomial derivatives in order to generate lesser shares for participants of lower levels. Consequently, our scheme uses Birkhoff interpolation, i.e., the construction of a polynomial according to an unstructured set of point and derivative values. A substantial part of our discussion is dedicated to the question of how to assign identities to the participants from the underlying finite field so that the resulting Birkhoff interpolation problem will be well posed. In the course of this discussion, we borrow some results from the theory of Birkhoff interpolation over ℝ and import them to the context of finite fields.",

      "abstract": "The ability to link two different sightings of the same Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tag enables invasions of privacy. The problem is aggravated when an item, and the tag attached to it, changes hands during the course of its lifetime. After such an ownership transfer, the new owner should be able to read the tag but the old owner should not. \n \nWe address these issues through an RFID pseudonym protocol. Each time it is queried, the RFID tag emits a different pseudonym using a pseudo-random function. Without consent of a special Trusted Center that shares secrets with the tag, it is infeasible to map the pseudonym to the tag's real identity. We present a scheme for RFID pseudonyms that works with legacy, untrusted readers, requires only one message from tag to reader, and is scalable: decoding tag pseudonyms takes work logarithmic in the number of tags. Our scheme further allows for time-limited delegation, so that we can give an RFID reader the power to disambiguate a limited number of pseudonyms without further help from the Trusted Center. We show how RFID pseudonyms facilitate the transfer of ownership of RFID tags between mutually distrustful parties. \n \nOur scheme requires only limited cryptographic functionality from the tag: we need a pseudo-random function (PRF) and the ability to update tag state or to generate random numbers. Tag storage and communication requirements are modest: we give example parameters for a deployment of one million tags in which each tag stores only 128 bits, makes 6 PRF evaluations, and sends 158 bits each time it is read.",

The honest verifier zero-knowledge argument has a size that is independent of the actual cryptosystem being used and will typically be smaller than the size of the shuffle itself. Moreover, our scheme is well suited for the use of multi-exponentiation and batch-verification techniques.Additionally, we suggest a more efficient honest verifier zero-knowledge argument for a commitment containing a permutation of a set of publicly known messages. We also suggest an honest verifier zero-knowledge argument for the correctness of a combined shuffle-and-decrypt operation that can be used in connection with decrypting mix-nets based on ElGamal encryption.All our honest verifier zero-knowledge arguments can be turned into honest verifier zero-knowledge proofs.

Unfortunately, construction of Certificateless Public Key Encryption (CLPKE) schemes has so far depended on the use of Identity-Based Encryption, which results in the bilinear pairing-based schemes that need costly operations. In this paper, we consider a relaxation of the original model of CLPKE and propose a new CLPKE scheme that does not depend on the bilinear pairings.

A point function is a Boolean function that assumes the value 1 at exactly one point. Our main results are as follows:We provide a simple construction of efficient obfuscators for point functions for a slightly relaxed notion of obfuscation, for which obfuscating general circuits is nonetheless impossible. Our construction relies on the existence of a very strong one-way permutation, and yields the first non-trivial obfuscator under general assumptions in the standard model. We also obtain obfuscators for point functions with multi-bit output and for prefix matching.Our assumption is that there is a one-way permutation wherein any polynomial-sized circuit inverts the permutation on at most a polynomial number of inputs. We show that a similar assumption is in fact necessary, and that our assumption holds relative to a random permutation oracle.Finally, we establish two impossibility results which indicate that the limitations on our construction, namely simulating only adversaries with single-bit output and using nonuniform advice in our simulator, are in some sense inherent.Previous work gave negative results for the general class of circuits (Barak et al., Crypto '01) and positive results in the random oracle model (Lynn et al., Eurocrypt '04) or under non-standard number-theoretic assumptions (Canetti, Crypto '97).

We provide a formal security definition for securely outsourcing computations from a computationally limited device to an untrusted helper. In our model, the adversarial environment writes the software for the helper, but then does not have direct communication with it once the device starts relying on it. In addition to security, we also provide a framework for quantifying the efficiency and checkability of an outsourcing implementation. We present two practical outsource-secure schemes. Specifically, we show how to securely outsource modular exponentiation, which presents the computational bottleneck in most public-key cryptography on computationally limited devices. Without outsourcing, a device would need O(n) modular multiplications to carry out modular exponentiation for n-bit exponents. The load reduces to O(log2n) for any exponentiation-based scheme where the honest device may use two untrusted exponentiation programs; we highlight the Cramer-Shoup cryptosystem [13] and Schnorr signatures [28] as examples. With a relaxed notion of security, we achieve the same load reduction for a new CCA2-secure encryption scheme using only one untrusted Cramer-Shoup encryption program.",

Our first result is a scheme, secure under the strong RSA and the y-DDHI assumptions, where the complexity of the withdrawal and spend operations is O( + k) and the user's wallet can be stored using O( + k) bits, where k is a security parameter. The best previously known schemes require at least one of these complexities to be O(2 . k). In fact, compared to previous e-cash schemes, our whole wallet of 2 coins has about the same size as one coin in these schemes. Our scheme also offers exculpability of users, that is, the bank can prove to third parties that a user has double-spent. We then extend our scheme to our second result, the first e-cash scheme that provides traceable coins without a trusted third party. That is, once a user has double spent one of the 2 coins in her wallet, all her spendings of these coins can be traced. However, the price for this is that the complexity of the spending and of the withdrawal protocols becomes O( . k) and O( . k+ k 2 ) bits, respectively, and wallets take O( . k) bits of storage.

In contrast to group signatures, ring signatures are completely “ad-hoc” and do not require any central authority or coordination among the various users (indeed, users do not even need to be aware of each other); furthermore, ring signature schemes grant users fine-grained control over the level of anonymity associated with any particular signature. \n \nThis paper has two main areas of focus. First, we examine previous definitions of security for ring signature schemes and suggest that most of these prior definitions are too weak, in the sense that they do not take into account certain realistic attacks. We propose new definitions of anonymity and unforgeability which address these threats, and then give separation results proving that our new notions are strictly stronger than previous ones. Next, we show two constructions of ring signature schemes in the standard model: one based on generic assumptions which satisfies our strongest definitions of security, and a second, more efficient scheme achieving weaker security guarantees and more limited functionality. These are the first constructions of ring signature schemes that do not rely on random oracles or ideal ciphers.",

What makes them especially attractive, is that they work equally well in a concurrent setting, which is notoriously hard for interactive zero-knowledge protocols. However, while for interactive zero-knowledge we know how to construct statistical zero-knowledge argument systems for all NP languages, for non-interactive zero-knowledge, this problem remained open since the inception of NIZK in the late 1980's. Here we resolve two problems regarding NIZK: \n \nWe construct the first perfect NIZK argument system for any NP language. \n \nWe construct the first UC-secure NIZK argument for any NP language in the presence of a dynamic/adaptive adversary. \n \nWhile it is already known how to construct efficient prover computational NIZK proofs for any NP language, the known techniques yield large common reference strings and large proofs. Another contribution of this paper is NIZK proofs with much shorter common reference string and proofs than previous constructions.",

However, subsequent attacks showed that assumption (2) is false for MD5 and SHA-1, removing the proof-based support for HMAC in these cases. This paper proves that HMAC is a PRF under the sole assumption that the compression function is a PRF. This recovers a proof-based guarantee since no known attacks compromise the pseudorandomness of the compression function, and it also helps explain the resistance to attack that HMAC has shown even when implemented with hash functions whose (weak) collision resistance is compromised. We also show that an even weaker than PRF condition on the compression function, namely that it is a privacy-preserving MAC, suffices to establish HMAC is a secure MAC as long as the hash function meets the very weak requirement of being computationally almost universal, where again the value lies in the fact that known attacks do not invalidate the assumptions made.",

      "abstract": "RFID technology arouses great interests from both its advocates and opponents because of the promising but privacy-threatening nature of low-cost RFID tags. A main privacy concern in RFID systems results from clandestine scanning through which an adversary could conduct silent tracking and inventorying of persons carrying tagged objects. Thus, the most important security requirement in designing RFID protocols is to ensure untraceability of RFID tags by unauthorized parties (even with knowledge of a tag secret due to no physical security of low-cost RFID tags). Previous work in this direction mainly focuses on backward untraceability, requiring that compromise of a tag secret should not help identify the tag from past communication transcripts. However, in this paper, we argue that forward untraceability, i.e., untraceability of future events even with knowledge of a current tag secret, should be considered as an equally or even more important security property in RFID protocol designs. Furthermore, RFID tags may often change hands during their lifetime and thus the problem of tag ownership transfer should be dealt with as another key issue in RFID privacy problems; once ownership of a tag is transferred to another party, the old owner should not be able to read the tag any more. It is rather obvious that complete transfer of tag ownership is possible only if some degree of forward untraceability is provided. We propose a strong and robust RFID authentication protocol satisfying both forward and backward untraceability and enabling complete transfer of tag ownership.",

The penalty paid (extra clock cycles) for a mispredicted branch can be used for cryptanalysis of cryptographic primitives that employ a data-dependent program flow. Analogous to the recently described cache-based side-channel attacks our attacks also allow an unprivileged process to attack other processes running in parallel on the same processor, despite sophisticated partitioning methods such as memory protection, sandboxing or even virtualization. In this paper, we will discuss several such attacks for the example of RSA, and experimentally show their applicability to real systems, such as OpenSSL and Linux. Moreover, we will also demonstrate the strength of the branch prediction side-channel attack by rendering the obvious countermeasure in this context (Montgomery Multiplication with dummy-reduction) as useless. Although the deeper consequences of the latter result make the task of writing an efficient and secure modular exponentiation (or scalar multiplication on an elliptic curve) a challenging task, we will eventually suggest some countermeasures to mitigate branch prediction side-channel attacks.",

The purpose of the noise generation is to create a distributed implementation of the privacy-preserving statistical databases described in recent papers [14,4,13]. In these databases, privacy is obtained by perturbing the true answer to a database query by the addition of a small amount of Gaussian or exponentially distributed random noise. The computational power of even a simple form of these databases, when the query is just of the form ∑if(di), that is, the sum over all rows i in the database of a function f applied to the data in row i, has been demonstrated in [4]. A distributed implementation eliminates the need for a trusted database administrator. \n \nThe results for noise generation are of independent interest. The generation of Gaussian noise introduces a technique for distributing shares of many unbiased coins with fewer executions of verifiable secret sharing than would be needed using previous approaches (reduced by a factor of n). The generation of exponentially distributed noise uses two shallow circuits: one for generating many arbitrarily but identically biased coins at an amortized cost of two unbiased random bits apiece, independent of the bias, and the other to combine bits of appropriate biases to obtain an exponential distribution.",

      "abstract": "We prove and extend a conjecture of Kempe, Kleinberg, and Tardos (KKT) on the spread of influence in social networks.\n A social network can be represented by a directed graph where the nodes are individuals and the edges indicate a form of social relationship. A simple way to model the diffusion of ideas, innovative behavior, or \"word-of-mouth\" effects on such a graph is to consider an increasing process of \"infected\" (or active) nodes: each node becomes infected once an activation function of the set of its infected neighbors crosses a certain threshold value. Such a model was introduced by KKT in [7,8] where the authors also impose several natural assumptions: the threshold values are (uniformly) random to account for our lack of knowledge of the true values; and the activation functions are monotone and submodular, i.e. have \"diminishing returns.\" The monotonicity condition indicates that a node is more likely to become active if more of its neighbors are active, while the submodularity condition, indicates that the marginal effect of each neighbor is decreasing when the set of active neighbors increases.\n For an initial set of active nodes s, let σ(S) denote the expected number of active nodes at termination. Here we prove a conjecture of KKT: we show that the function σ(S) is submodular under the assumptions above. We prove the same result for the expected value of any monotone, submodular function of the set of active nodes at termination.\n In other words, our results demonstrate that \"local\" submodularity is preserved \"globally\" under diffusion processes. This is of natural computational interest, as many optimization problems have good approximation algorithms for submodular functions. In particular, our results coupled with an argument in [7] imply that a greedy algorithm gives an (1-1/e-ε)-approximation algorithm for maximizing σ(S) among all sets s of a given size. This result has important practical implications for many social network analysis problems, notably viral marketing.",

It also has a very constructive appeal, which we demonstrate with a new encryption scheme whose security relies on a class of intractability assumptions that we show (in the generic group model) strictly weaker than the Decision Diffie-Hellman (DDH) assumption.

The model generates probabilistic proofs of possession by sampling random sets of blocks from the server, which drastically reduces I/O costs. The client maintains a constant amount of metadata to verify the proof. The challenge/response protocol transmits a small, constant amount of data, which minimizes network communication. Thus, the PDP model for remote data checking supports large data sets in widely-distributed storage system.\n We present two provably-secure PDP schemes that are more efficient than previous solutions, even when compared with schemes that achieve weaker guarantees. In particular, the overhead at the server is low (or even constant), as opposed to linear in the size of the data. Experiments using our implementation verify the practicality of PDP and reveal that the performance of PDP is bounded by disk I/O and not by cryptographic computation.",

That is, the noise magnitude is determined not only by the function we want to release, but also bythe database itself. One of the challenges is to ensure that the noise magnitude does not leak information about the database. To address that, we calibrate the noise magnitude to the smoothsensitivity of f on the database x --- a measure of variabilityof f in the neighborhood of the instance x. The new frameworkgreatly expands the applicability of output perturbation, a technique for protecting individuals' privacy by adding a smallamount of random noise to the released statistics. To our knowledge, this is the first formal analysis of the effect of instance-basednoise in the context of data privacy.\n Our framework raises many interesting algorithmic questions. Namely,to apply the framework one must compute or approximate the smoothsensitivity of f on x. We show how to do this efficiently for several different functions, including the median and the cost ofthe minimum spanning tree. We also give a generic procedure based on sampling that allows one to release f(x) accurately on manydatabases x. This procedure is applicable even when no efficient algorithm for approximating smooth sensitivity of f is known orwhen f is given as a black box. We illustrate the procedure by applying it to k-SED (k-means) clustering and learning mixtures of Gaussians.",

Storage is private in the sense that an adversary does not have read access to Σ(G) at all. However, Σ(G) is non-robust in the sense that the adversary can modify its contents by adding some offset Δ ∈ G. Due to the privacy of the storage device, the value Δ can only depend on an adversary's a priori knowledge of x. We introduce a new primitive called an algebraic manipulation detection (AMD) code, which encodes a source s into a value x stored on Σ(G) so that any tampering by an adversary will be detected. We give a nearly optimal construction of AMD codes, which can flexibly accommodate arbitrary choices for the length of the source s and security level. We use this construction in two applications: - We show how to efficiently convert any linear secret sharing scheme into a robust secret sharing scheme, which ensures that no unqualified subset of players can modify their shares and cause the reconstruction of some value s′ ≠ s. - We show how to build nearly optimal robust fuzzy extractors for several natural metrics. Robust fuzzy extractors enable one to reliably extract and later recover random keys from noisy and non-uniform secrets, such as biometrics, by relying only on non-robust public storage. In the past, such constructions were known only in the random oracle model, or required the entropy rate of the secret to be greater than half.

      "abstract": "We show an efficient secure two-party protocol, based on Yao’s construction, which provides security against malicious adversaries. Yao’s original protocol is only secure in the presence of semi-honest adversaries, and can be transformed into a protocol that achieves security against malicious adversaries by applying the compiler of Goldreich, Micali, and Wigderson (the “GMW compiler”). However, this approach does not seem to be very practical as it requires using generic zero-knowledge proofs. Our construction is based on applying cut-and-choose techniques to the original circuit and inputs. Security is proved according to the ideal/real simulation paradigm, and the proof is in the standard model (with no random oracle model or common reference string assumptions). The resulting protocol is computationally efficient: the only usage of asymmetric cryptography is for running $$O(1)$$O(1) oblivious transfers for each input bit (or for each bit of a statistical security parameter, whichever is larger). Our protocol combines techniques from folklore (like cut-and-choose) along with new techniques for efficiently proving consistency of inputs. We remark that a naive implementation of the cut-and-choose technique with Yao’s protocol does not yield a secure protocol. This is the first paper to show how to properly implement these techniques, and to provide a full proof of security. Our protocol can also be interpreted as a constant-round black-box reduction of secure two-party computation to oblivious transfer and perfectly hiding commitments, or a black-box reduction of secure two-party computation to oblivious transfer alone, with a number of rounds which is linear in a statistical security parameter. These two reductions are comparable to Kilian’s (20th STOC, 1988) reduction, which uses OT alone but incurs a number of rounds which is linear in the depth of the circuit.",

      "abstract": "Identity-based encryption (IBE) is an exciting alternative to public-key encryption, as IBE eliminates the need for a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). The senders using an IBE do not need to look up the public keys and the corresponding certificates of the receivers, the identities (e.g. emails or IP addresses) of the latter are sufficient to encrypt. Any setting, PKI- or identity-based, must provide a means to revoke users from the system. Efficient revocation is a well-studied problem in the traditional PKI setting. However in the setting of IBE, there has been little work on studying the revocation mechanisms. The most practical solution requires the senders to also use time periods when encrypting, and all the receivers (regardless of whether their keys have been compromised or not) to update their private keys regularly by contacting the trusted authority. We note that this solution does not scale well -- as the number of users increases, the work on key updates becomes a bottleneck. We propose an IBE scheme that significantly improves key-update efficiency on the side of the trusted party (from linear to logarithmic in the number of users), while staying efficient for the users. Our scheme builds on the ideas of the Fuzzy IBE primitive and binary tree data structure, and is provably secure.",

Chase proposed the first multi authority ABE scheme in TCC 2007 as an answer to an open problem presented by Sahai and Waters in EUROCRYPT 2005. However, her scheme needs a fully trusted central authority which can decrypt every ciphertext in the system. This central authority would endanger the whole system if it's corrupted. \n \nThis paper presents a threshold multi authority fuzzy identity based encryption(MA-FIBE) scheme without a central authority for the first time. An encrypter can encrypt a message such that a user could only decrypt if he has at least d k of the given attributes about the message for at least t + 1, t ≤ n /2 honest authorities of all the n attribute authorities in the proposed scheme. The security proof is based on the secrecy of the underlying joint random secret sharing protocol and joint zero secret sharing protocol and the standard decisional bilinear Diffie-Hellman assumption. The proposed MA-FIBE could be extended to the threshold multi authority attribute based encryption (MA-ABE) scheme and be further extended to a proactive MA-ABE scheme.",

      "abstract": "The success of electronic authentication systems, be it e-ID card systems or Internet authentication systems such as CardSpace, highly depends on the provided level of user-privacy. Thereby, an important requirement is an efficient means for revocation of the authentication credentials. In this paper we consider the problem of revocation for certificate-based privacy-protecting authentication systems. To date, the most efficient solutions for revocation for such systems are based on cryptographic accumulators. Here, an accumulate of all currently valid certificates is published regularly and each user holds a witness enabling her to prove the validity of her (anonymous) credential while retaining anonymity. Unfortunately, the users' witnesses must be updated at least each time a credential is revoked. For the know solutions, these updates are computationally very expensive for users and/or certificate issuers which is very problematic as revocation is a frequent event as practice shows. \n \nIn this paper, we propose a new dynamic accumulator scheme based on bilinear maps and show how to apply it to the problem of revocation of anonymous credentials. In the resulting scheme, proving a credential's validity and updating witnesses both come at (virtually) no cost for credential owners and verifiers. In particular, updating a witness requires the issuer to do only one multiplication per addition or revocation of a credential and can also be delegated to untrusted entities from which a user could just retrieve the updated witness. We believe that thereby we provide the first authentication system offering privacy protection suitable for implementation with electronic tokens such as eID cards or drivers' licenses.",

      "abstract": "In this work, we design a method for creating public key broadcast encryption systems. Our main technical innovation is based on a new \"two equation\" technique for revoking users. This technique results in two key contributions: First, our new scheme has ciphertext size overhead $O(r)$, where $r$ is the number of revoked users, and the size of public and private keys is only a \\emph{constant} number of group elements from an elliptic-curve group of prime order. In addition, the public key allows us to encrypt to an unbounded number of users. Our system is the first to achieve such parameters. We give two versions of our scheme: a simpler version which we prove to be selectively secure in the standard model under a new, but non-interactive assumption, and another version that employs the new dual system encryption technique of Waters to obtain adaptive security under the d-BDH and decisional Linear assumptions. Second, we show that our techniques can be used to realize Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) systems with non-monotonic access formulas, where our key storage is significantly more efficient than previous solutions. This result is also proven selectively secure in the standard model under our new non-interactive assumption.",

The novelty of our solution is in the choice of the secret sharing scheme and the design of the protocol suite. We have made many practical decisions to make large-scale share computing feasible in practice.

In the provable data possession (PDP) model, the client preprocesses the data and then sends it to an untrusted server for storage, while keeping a small amount of meta-data. The client later asks the server to prove that the stored data has not been tampered with or deleted (without downloading the actual data). However, the original PDP scheme applies only to static (or append-only) files.\n We present a definitional framework and efficient constructions for dynamic provable data possession (DPDP), which extends the PDP model to support provable updates to stored data. We use a new version of authenticated dictionaries based on rank information. The price of dynamic updates is a performance change from O(1) to O(logn) (or O(nεlog n), for a file consisting of n blocks, while maintaining the same (or better, respectively) probability of misbehavior detection. Our experiments show that this slowdown is very low in practice (e.g. 415KB proof size and 30ms computational overhead for a 1GB file). We also show how to apply our DPDP scheme to outsourced file systems and version control systems (e.g. CVS).",

      "abstract": "Current tools for analysing information flow in programs build upon ideas going back to Denning's work from the 70's. These systems enforce an imperfect notion of information flow which has become known as termination-insensitive noninterference. Under this version of noninterference, information leaks are permitted if they are transmitted purely by the program's termination behaviour (i.e., whether it terminates or not). This imperfection is the price to pay for having a security condition which is relatively liberal (e.g. allowing while-loops whose termination may depend on the value of a secret) and easy to check. But what is the price exactly? We argue that, in the presence of output, the price is higher than the \"one bit\" often claimed informally in the literature, and effectively such programs can leak all of their secrets. In this paper we develop a definition of termination-insensitive noninterference suitable for reasoning about programs with outputs. We show that the definition generalises \"batch-job\" style definitions from the literature and that it is indeed satisfied by a Denning-style program analysis with output. Although more than a bit of information can be leaked by programs satisfying this condition, we show that the best an attacker can do is a brute-force attack, which means that the attacker cannot reliably (in a technical sense) learn the secret in polynomial time in the size of the secret. If we further assume that secrets are uniformly distributed, we show that the advantage the attacker gains when guessing the secret after observing a polynomial amount of output is negligible in the size of the secret.",

The goal of such research is to identify broad and natural classes of strategy sets and payoff functions which enable the design of efficient solutions.\n In this work we study a very general setting for the multi-armed bandit problem in which the strategies form a metric space, and the payoff function satisfies a Lipschitz condition with respect to the metric. We refer to this problem as the \"Lipschitz MAB problem\". We present a complete solution for the multi-armed problem in this setting. That is, for every metric space (L,X) we define an isometry invariant Max Min COV(X) which bounds from below the performance of Lipschitz MAB algorithms for $X$, and we present an algorithm which comes arbitrarily close to meeting this bound.

To do so, we propose a slightly weaker notion of security, saying that no partial information about encrypted messages should be leaked as long as each message is a-priori hard-to-guess given the others(while PRIV did not have the latter restriction). Nevertheless, we argue that this version seems adequate for many practical applications. We show equivalence of this definition to single-message and indistinguishability-based ones, which are easier to work with. Then we give general constructions of both chosen-plaintext (CPA) and chosen-ciphertext-attack (CCA) secure deterministic encryption schemes, as well as efficient instantiations of them under standard number-theoretic assumptions.

Most importantly, our protocols are privacy-preserving, in that they never reveal the data contents to the auditor. Our solution removes the burden of verification from the customer, alleviates both the customer’s and storage service’s fear of data leakage, and provides a method for independent arbitration of data retention contracts.",

      "abstract": "We present a simple and efficient compiler for transforming secure multi-party computation (MPC) protocols that enjoy security only with an honest majority into MPC protocols that guarantee security with no honest majority, in the oblivious-transfer (OT) hybrid model. Our technique works by combining a secure protocol in the honest majority setting with a protocol achieving only security against semi-honestparties in the setting of no honest majority. \n \nApplying our compiler to variants of protocols from the literature, we get several applications for secure two-party computation and for MPC with no honest majority. These include: \n \n \n Constant-rate two-party computation in the OT-hybrid model. We obtain a statistically UC-secure two-party protocol in the OT-hybrid model that can evaluate a general circuit Cof size sand depth dwith a total communication complexity of O(s) + poly(k, d, log s) and O(d) rounds. The above result generalizes to a constant number of parties. \n Extending OTs in the malicious model. We obtain a computationally efficient protocol for generating many string OTs from few string OTs with only a constant amortized communication overheadcompared to the total length of the string OTs. \n Black-box constructions for constant-round MPC with no honest majority. We obtain general computationally UC-secure MPC protocols in the OT-hybrid model that use only a constant number of rounds, and only make a black-boxaccess to a pseudorandom generator. This gives the first constant-round protocols for three or more parties that only make a black-box use of cryptographic primitives (and avoid expensive zero-knowledge proofs).",

      "abstract": "We describe a public-key encryption system that remains secure even encrypting messages that depend on the secret keys in use. In particular, it remains secure under a \"key cycle\" usage, where we have a cycle of public/secret key-pairs (pk i ,sk i ) for i= 1,...,n, and we encrypt each sk i under ${\\rm pk}_{(i \\bmod n)+1}$. Such usage scenarios sometimes arise in key-management systems and in the context of anonymous credential systems. Also, security against key cycles plays a role when relating \"axiomatic security\" of protocols that use encryption to the \"computational security\" of concrete instantiations of these protocols. \n \nThe existence of encryption systems that are secure in the presence of key cycles was wide open until now: on the one hand we had no constructions that provably meet this notion of security (except by relying on the random-oracle heuristic); on the other hand we had no examples of secure encryption systems that become demonstrably insecure in the presence of key-cycles of length greater than one. \n \nHere we construct an encryption system that is circular-secure against chosen-plaintext attacks under the Decision Diffie-Hellman assumption (without relying on random oracles). Our proof of security holds even if the adversary obtains an encryption clique, that is, encryptions of sk i under pk j for all 1 ≤ i,j≤ n. We also construct a circular counterexample: a one-way secure encryption scheme that breaks completely if an encryption cycle (of any size) is published.",

      "abstract": "A mechanism for releasing information about a statistical database with sensitive data must resolve a trade-off between utility and privacy. Publishing fully accurate information maximizes utility while minimizing privacy, while publishing random noise accomplishes the opposite. Privacy can be rigorously quantified using the framework of differential privacy, which requires that a mechanism's output distribution is nearly the same whether or not a given database row is included or excluded. The goal of this paper is strong and general utility guarantees, subject to differential privacy. We pursue mechanisms that guarantee near-optimal utility to every potential user, independent of its side information (modeled as a prior distribution over query results) and preferences (modeled via a loss function). Our main result is: for each fixed count query and differential privacy level, there is a geometric mechanism M* -- a discrete variant of the simple and well-studied Laplace mechanism -- that is simultaneously expected loss-minimizing for every possible user, subject to the differential privacy constraint. This is an extremely strong utility guarantee: every potential user u, no matter what its side information and preferences, derives as much utility from M* as from interacting with a differentially private mechanism Mu that is optimally tailored to u. More precisely, for every user u there is an optimal mechanism Mu for it that factors into a user-independent part (the geometric mechanism M*) followed by user-specific post-processing that can be delegated to the user itself. The first part of our proof of this result characterizes the optimal differentially private mechanism for a fixed but arbitrary user in terms of a certain basic feasible solution to a linear program with constraints that encode differential privacy. The second part shows that all of the relevant vertices of this polytope (ranging over all possible users) are derivable from the geometric mechanism via suitable remappings of its range.",

      "abstract": "Storage outsourcing is a rising trend which prompts a number of interesting security issues, many of which have been extensively investigated in the past. However, Provable Data Possession (PDP) is a topic that has only recently appeared in the research literature. The main issue is how to frequently, efficiently and securely verify that a storage server is faithfully storing its client's (potentially very large) outsourced data. The storage server is assumed to be untrusted in terms of both security and reliability. (In other words, it might maliciously or accidentally erase hosted data; it might also relegate it to slow or off-line storage.) The problem is exacerbated by the client being a small computing device with limited resources. Prior work has addressed this problem using either public key cryptography or requiring the client to outsource its data in encrypted form.\n In this paper, we construct a highly efficient and provably secure PDP technique based entirely on symmetric key cryptography, while not requiring any bulk encryption. Also, in contrast with its predecessors, our PDP technique allows outsourcing of dynamic data, i.e, it efficiently supports operations, such as block modification, deletion and append.",

The previous construction of Boneh, Boyen, and Goh was only proven to be secure in the selective model, under a non-static assumption which depended on the depth of the hierarchy. To obtain full security, we apply the dual system encryption concept recently introduced by Waters. A straightforward application of this technique is insufficient to achieve short ciphertexts, since the original instantiation of the technique includes tags that do not compress. To overcome this challenge, we design a new method for realizing dual system encryption. We provide a system in composite order groups (of three primes) and prove the security of our (first) scheme under three static assumptions. In addition, we provide a prime order group analog of our first scheme and prove it secure in asymmetric bilinear groups. ∗Supported by National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship. †Supported by NSF CNS-0716199, CNS-0915361 and Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFO SR) under the MURI award for “Collaborative policies and assured information sharing” (Project PRESIDIO).",

The protocol requires a one-time pre-processing stage by the client which takes O(|C|ċpoly(λ)) time, where C is the smallest known Boolean circuit computing F. Unlike previous work in this area, our scheme also provides (at no additional cost) input and output privacy for the client, meaning that the workers do not learn any information about the xi or yi values.",

The sanitization may be in the form of an arbitrary data structure, accompanied by a computational procedure for determining approximate answers to queries on the original data set, or it may be a \"synthetic data set\" consisting of data items drawn from the same universe as items in the original data set; queries are carried out as if the synthetic data set were the actual input. In either case the process is non-interactive; once the sanitization has been released the original data and the curator play no further role.\n For the task of sanitizing with a synthetic dataset output, we map the boundary between computational feasibility and infeasibility with respect to a variety of utility measures. For the (potentially easier) task of sanitizing with unrestricted output format, we show a tight qualitative and quantitative connection between hardness of sanitizing and the existence of traitor tracing schemes.",

Ciphertext-Policy ABE (CP-ABE) is a form of ABE where policies are associated with encrypted data and attributes are associated with keys. In this work we focus on improving the flexibility of representing user attributes in keys. Specifically, we propose Ciphertext Policy Attribute Set Based Encryption (CP-ASBE) - a new form of CP-ABE - which, unlike existing CP-ABE schemes that represent user attributes as a monolithic set in keys, organizes user attributes into a recursive set based structure and allows users to impose dynamic constraints on how those attributes may be combined to satisfy a policy.

Our solution comes in three steps. First, we provide a general result -- that, to construct an encryption scheme that permits evaluation of arbitrary circuits, it suffices to construct an encryption scheme that can evaluate (slightly augmented versions of) its own decryption circuit; we call a scheme that can evaluate its (augmented) decryption circuit bootstrappable.\n Next, we describe a public key encryption scheme using ideal lattices that is almost bootstrappable.\n Lattice-based cryptosystems typically have decryption algorithms with low circuit complexity, often dominated by an inner product computation that is in NC1. Also, ideal lattices provide both additive and multiplicative homomorphisms (modulo a public-key ideal in a polynomial ring that is represented as a lattice), as needed to evaluate general circuits.\n Unfortunately, our initial scheme is not quite bootstrappable -- i.e., the depth that the scheme can correctly evaluate can be logarithmic in the lattice dimension, just like the depth of the decryption circuit, but the latter is greater than the former. In the final step, we show how to modify the scheme to reduce the depth of the decryption circuit, and thereby obtain a bootstrappable encryption scheme, without reducing the depth that the scheme can evaluate. Abstractly, we accomplish this by enabling the encrypter to start the decryption process, leaving less work for the decrypter, much like the server leaves less work for the decrypter in a server-aided cryptosystem.",

However, the rapid improvement and widespread deployment of this technology raises strong concerns regarding the violation of individuals' privacy. A typical application scenario for privacy-preserving face recognition concerns a client who privately searches for a specific face image in the face image database of a server. \n \nIn this paper we present a privacy-preserving face recognition scheme that substantially improves over previouswork in terms of communication-and computation efficiency: the most recent proposal of Erkin et al. (PETS'09) requires O(log M) rounds and computationally expensive operations on homomorphically encrypted data to recognize a face in a database of M faces. Our improved scheme requires only O(1) rounds and has a substantially smaller online communication complexity (by a factor of 15 for each database entry) and less computation complexity. \n \nOur solution is based on known cryptographic building blocks combining homomorphic encryption with garbled circuits. Our implementation results show the practicality of our scheme also for large databases (e.g., for M = 1000 we need less than 13 seconds and less than 4 MByte on-line communication on two 2.4GHz PCs connected via Gigabit Ethernet).",

We then demonstrate how semi-homomorphic encryption schemes allow us to construct an efficient multiparty computation protocol for arithmetic circuits, UC-secure against a dishonest majority. The protocol consists of a preprocessing phase and an online phase. Neither the inputs nor the function to be computed have to be known during preprocessing. Moreover, the online phase is extremely efficient as it requires no cryptographic operations: the parties only need to exchange additive shares and verify information theoretic MACs.

Such knowledge is highly valuable in a variety of security and forensic applications. Although there exist efforts in program data structure inference, the existing solutions are not suitable for our targeted application scenarios. In this paper, we propose a reverse engineering technique to automatically reveal program data structures from binaries. Our technique, called REWARDS, is based on dynamic analysis. More specifically, each memory location accessed by the program is tagged with a timestamped type attribute. Following the program's runtime data flow, this attribute is propagated to other memory locations and registers that share the same type. During the propagation, a variable's type gets resolved if it is involved in a type-revealing execution point or type sink. More importantly, besides the forward type propagation, REWARDS involves a backward type resolution procedure where the types of some previously accessed variables get recursively resolved starting from a type sink. This procedure is constrained by the timestamps of relevant memory locations to disambiguate variables re-using the same memory location. In addition, REWARDS is able to reconstruct in-memory data structure layout based on the type information derived. We demonstrate that REWARDS provides unique benefits to two applications: memory image forensics and binary fuzzing for vulnerability discovery.",

In contrast to much of the existing work on dynamic networks, we do not assume that the network eventually stops changing; we require correctness and termination even in networks that change continually. We introduce a stability property called T -interval connectivity (for T >= 1), which stipulates that for every T consecutive rounds there exists a stable connected spanning subgraph. For T = 1 this means that the graph is connected in every round, but changes arbitrarily between rounds.\n We show that in 1-interval connected graphs it is possible for nodes to determine the size of the network and compute any com- putable function of their initial inputs in O(n2) rounds using messages of size O(log n + d), where d is the size of the input to a single node. Further, if the graph is T-interval connected for T > 1, the computation can be sped up by a factor of T, and any function can be computed in O(n + n2/T) rounds using messages of size O(log n + d). We also give two lower bounds on the token dissemination problem, which requires the nodes to disseminate k pieces of information to all the nodes in the network.\n The T-interval connected dynamic graph model is a novel model, which we believe opens new avenues for research in the theory of distributed computing in wireless, mobile and dynamic networks.",

      "abstract": "As Cloud Computing becomes prevalent, more and more sensitive information are being centralized into the cloud. For the protection of data privacy, sensitive data usually have to be encrypted before outsourcing, which makes effective data utilization a very challenging task. Although traditional searchable encryption schemes allow a user to securely search over encrypted data through keywords and selectively retrieve files of interest, these techniques support only exact keyword search. That is, there is no tolerance of minor typos and format inconsistencies which, on the other hand, are typical user searching behavior and happen very frequently. This significant drawback makes existing techniques unsuitable in Cloud Computing as it greatly affects system usability, rendering user searching experiences very frustrating and system efficacy very low. In this paper, for the first time we formalize and solve the problem of effective fuzzy keyword search over encrypted cloud data while maintaining keyword privacy. Fuzzy keyword search greatly enhances system usability by returning the matching files when users' searching inputs exactly match the predefined keywords or the closest possible matching files based on keyword similarity semantics, when exact match fails. In our solution, we exploit edit distance to quantify keywords similarity and develop an advanced technique on constructing fuzzy keyword sets, which greatly reduces the storage and representation overheads. Through rigorous security analysis, we show that our proposed solution is secure and privacy-preserving, while correctly realizing the goal of fuzzy keyword search.",

      "abstract": "A number of works have investigated using tamper-proof hardware tokens as tools to achieve a variety of cryptographic tasks. In particular, Goldreich and Ostrovsky considered the problem of software protection via oblivious RAM. Goldwasser, Kalai, and Rothblum introduced the concept of one-time programs: in a one-time program, an honest sender sends a set of simple hardware tokens to a (potentially malicious) receiver. The hardware tokens allow the receiver to execute a secret program specified by the sender’s tokens exactly once (or, more generally, up to a fixed t times). A recent line of work initiated by Katz examined the problem of achieving UC-secure computation using hardware tokens. \n \nMotivated by the goal of unifying and strengthening these previous notions, we consider the general question of basing secure computation on hardware tokens. We show that the following tasks, which cannot be realized in the “plain” model, become feasible if the parties are allowed to generate and exchange tamper-proof hardware tokens. \n \nUnconditional and non-interactive secure computation. We show that by exchanging simple stateful hardware tokens, any functionality can be realized with unconditional security against malicious parties. In the case of two-party functionalities f(x,y) which take their inputs from a sender and a receiver and deliver their output to the receiver, our protocol is non-interactive and only requires a unidirectional communication of simple stateful tokens from the sender to the receiver. This strengthens previous feasibility results for one-time programs both by providing unconditional security and by offering general protection against malicious senders. As is typically the case for unconditionally secure protocols, our protocol is in fact UC-secure. This improves over previous works on UC-secure computation based on hardware tokens, which provided computational security under cryptographic assumptions. \n \nInteractive secure computation from stateless tokens based on one-way functions. We show that stateless hardware tokens are sufficient to base general secure (in fact, UC-secure) computation on the existence of one-way functions. \n \nObfuscation from stateless tokens. We consider the problem of realizing non-interactive secure computation from stateless tokens for functionalities which allow the receiver to provide an arbitrary number of inputs (these are the only functionalities one can hope to realize non-interactively with stateless tokens). By building on recent techniques for resettably secure computation, we obtain a general positive result under standard cryptographic assumptions. This gives the first general feasibility result for program obfuscation using stateless tokens, while strengthening the standard notion of obfuscation by providing security against a malicious sender.",

      "abstract": "Cloud Computing is the long dreamed vision of computing as a utility, where users can remotely store their data into the cloud so as to enjoy the on-demand high quality applications and services from a shared pool of configurable computing resources. By data outsourcing, users can be relieved from the burden of local data storage and maintenance. However, the fact that users no longer have physical possession of the possibly large size of outsourced data makes the data integrity protection in Cloud Computing a very challenging and potentially formidable task, especially for users with constrained computing resources and capabilities. Thus, enabling public auditability for cloud data storage security is of critical importance so that users can resort to an external audit party to check the integrity of outsourced data when needed. To securely introduce an effective third party auditor (TPA), the following two fundamental requirements have to be met: 1) TPA should be able to efficiently audit the cloud data storage without demanding the local copy of data, and introduce no additional on-line burden to the cloud user; 2) The third party auditing process should bring in no new vulnerabilities towards user data privacy. In this paper, we utilize and uniquely combine the public key based homomorphic authenticator with random masking to achieve the privacy-preserving public cloud data auditing system, which meets all above requirements. To support efficient handling of multiple auditing tasks, we further explore the technique of bilinear aggregate signature to extend our main result into a multi-user setting, where TPA can perform multiple auditing tasks simultaneously. Extensive security and performance analysis shows the proposed schemes are provably secure and highly efficient.",

TASTY is a new compiler that can generate protocols based on homomorphic encryption and efficient garbled circuits as well as combinations of both, which often yields the most efficient protocols available today. The user provides a high-level description of the computations to be performed on encrypted data in a domain-specific language. This is automatically transformed into a protocol. TASTY provides most recent techniques and optimizations for practical secure two-party computation with low online latency. Moreover, it allows to efficiently evaluate circuits generated by the well-known Fairplay compiler.\n We use TASTY to compare protocols for secure multiplication based on homomorphic encryption with those based on garbled circuits and highly efficient Karatsuba multiplication. Further, we show how TASTY improves the online latency for securely evaluating the AES functionality by an order of magnitude compared to previous software implementations.

We show how to achieve efficient privacy-preserving data access using a combination of probabilistic encryption, which directly hides data values, and stateless oblivious RAM simulation, which hides the pattern of data accesses. We give a method with O(log n) amortized access overhead for simulating a RAM algorithm that has a memory of size n, using a scheme that is data-oblivious with very high probability. We assume that the simulation has access to a private workspace of size O(nv), for any given fixed constant v > 0, but does not maintain state in between data access requests. Our simulation makes use of pseudorandom hash functions and is based on a novel hierarchy of cuckoo hash tables that all share a common stash. The method outperforms all previous techniques for stateless clients in terms of access overhead. We also provide experimental results from a prototype implementation of our scheme, showing its practicality. In addition, we show that one can eliminate the dependence on pseudorandom hash functions in our simulation while having the overhead rise to be O(log2 n).",

      "abstract": "The prospect of outsourcing an increasing amount of data storage and management to cloud services raises many new privacy concerns for individuals and businesses alike. The privacy concerns can be satisfactorily addressed if users encrypt the data they send to the cloud. If the encryption scheme is homomorphic, the cloud can still perform meaningful computations on the data, even though it is encrypted.\n In fact, we now know a number of constructions of fully homomorphic encryption schemes that allow arbitrary computation on encrypted data. In the last two years, solutions for fully homomorphic encryption have been proposed and improved upon, but it is hard to ignore the elephant in the room, namely efficiency -- can homomorphic encryption ever be efficient enough to be practical? Certainly, it seems that all known fully homomorphic encryption schemes have a long way to go before they can be used in practice. Given this state of affairs, our contribution is two-fold.\n First, we exhibit a number of real-world applications, in the medical, financial, and the advertising domains, which require only that the encryption scheme is \"somewhat\" homomorphic. Somewhat homomorphic encryption schemes, which support a limited number of homomorphic operations, can be much faster, and more compact than fully homomorphic encryption schemes.\n Secondly, we show a proof-of-concept implementation of the recent somewhat homomorphic encryption scheme of Brakerski and Vaikuntanathan, whose security relies on the \"ring learning with errors\" (Ring LWE) problem. The scheme is very efficient, and has reasonably short ciphertexts. Our unoptimized implementation in magma enjoys comparable efficiency to even optimized pairing-based schemes with the same level of security and homomorphic capacity. We also show a number of application-specific optimizations to the encryption scheme, most notably the ability to convert between different message encodings in a ciphertext.",

      "abstract": "We present a radically new approach to fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) that dramatically improves performance and bases security on weaker assumptions. A central conceptual contribution in our work is a new way of constructing leveled fully homomorphic encryption schemes (capable of evaluating arbitrary polynomial-size circuits), without Gentry’s bootstrapping procedure. Specifically, we offer a choice of FHE schemes based on the learning with error (LWE) or ring-LWE (RLWE) problems that have 2 security against known attacks. For RLWE, we have: • A leveled FHE scheme that can evaluate L-level arithmetic circuits with O(λ · L) per-gate computation – i.e., computation quasi-linear in the security parameter. Security is based on RLWE for an approximation factor exponential in L. This construction does not use the bootstrapping procedure. • A leveled FHE scheme that uses bootstrapping as an optimization, where the per-gate computation (which includes the bootstrapping procedure) is O(λ), independent of L. Security is based on the hardness of RLWE for quasi-polynomial factors (as opposed to the sub-exponential factors needed in previous schemes). We obtain similar results for LWE, but with worse performance. We introduce a number of further optimizations to our schemes. As an example, for circuits of large width – e.g., where a constant fraction of levels have width at least λ – we can reduce the per-gate computation of the bootstrapped version to O(λ), independent of L, by batching the bootstrapping operation. Previous FHE schemes all required Ω(λ) computation per gate. At the core of our construction is a much more effective approach for managing the noise level of lattice-based ciphertexts as homomorphic operations are performed, using some new techniques recently introduced by Brakerski and Vaikuntanathan (FOCS 2011). ∗Sponsored by the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL).

      "abstract": "We further the study of order-preserving symmetric encryption (OPE), a primitive for allowing efficient range queries on encrypted data, recently initiated (from a cryptographic perspective) by Boldyreva et al. (Eurocrypt'09). First, we address the open problem of characterizing what encryption via a random order-preserving function (ROPF) leaks about underlying data (ROPF being the \"ideal object\" in the security definition, POPF, satisfied by their scheme.) In particular, we show that, for a database of randomly distributed plaintexts and appropriate choice of parameters, ROPF encryption leaks neither the precise value of any plaintext nor the precise distance between any two of them. The analysis here is quite technically non-trivial and introduces useful new techniques. On the other hand, we also show that ROPF encryption does leak both the value of any plaintext as well as the distance between any two plaintexts to within a range of possibilities roughly the square root of the domain size. We then study schemes that are not order-preserving, but which nevertheless allow efficient range queries and achieve security notions stronger than POPF. In a setting where the entire database is known in advance of key-generation (considered in several prior works), we show that recent constructions of \"monotone minimal perfect hash functions\" allow to efficiently achieve (an adaptation of) the notion of IND-O(rdered) CPA also considered by Boldyreva et al., which asks that only the order relations among the plaintexts is leaked. Finally, we introduce modular order-preserving encryption (MOPE), in which the scheme of Boldyreva et al. is prepended with a shift cipher. MOPE improves the security of OPE in a sense, as it does not leak any information about plaintext location. We clarify that our work should not be interpreted as saying the original scheme of Boldyreva et al., or the variants that we introduce, are \"secure\" or \"insecure.\" Rather, the goal of this line of research is to help practitioners decide whether the options provide a suitable security-functionality tradeoff for a given application.",

However, outsourcing computation is useful only when the returned result can be trusted, which makes verifiable computation (VC) a must for such scenarios. \n \nIn this work we extend the definition of verifiable computation in two important directions: public delegation and public verifiability, which have important applications in many practical delegation scenarios. Yet, existing VC constructions based on standard cryptographic assumptions fail to achieve these properties. \n \nAs the primary contribution of our work, we establish an important (and somewhat surprising) connection between verifiable computation and attribute-based encryption (ABE), a primitive that has been widely studied. Namely, we show how to construct a VC scheme with public delegation and public verifiability from any ABE scheme. The VC scheme verifies any function in the class of functions covered by the permissible ABE policies (currently Boolean formulas). This scheme enjoys a very efficient verification algorithm that depends only on the output size. Efficient delegation, however, requires the ABE encryption algorithm to be cheaper than the original function computation. Strengthening this connection, we show a construction of a multi-function verifiable computation scheme from an ABE scheme with outsourced decryption, a primitive defined recently by Green, Hohenberger and Waters (USENIX Security 2011). A multi-function VC scheme allows the verifiable evaluation of multiple functions on the same preprocessed input. \n \nIn the other direction, we also explore the construction of an ABE scheme from verifiable computation protocols.",

Do this by adding a ``hint \" to the SHWE public key -- namely, a large set of vectors that has a secret sparse subset that sums to the original secret key.* Bootstrap: Given a SWHE scheme that can evaluate functions twice as complex as its decryption function, apply Gentry's transformation to get a ``leveled\" FHE scheme. To get ``pure\" (non-leveled) FHE, one assumes circular security. Here, we describe a new blueprint for FHE. We show how to eliminate the squashing step, and thereby eliminate the need to assume that the sparse subset sum problem (SSSP) is hard, as all previous leveled FHE schemes have done. Using our new blueprint, we obtain the following results:* A ``simple\" leveled FHE scheme where we replace SSSP with Decision Diffie-Hellman!* The first leveled FHE scheme based entirely on worst-case hardness}. Specifically, we give a leveled FHE scheme with security based on the shortest independent vector problem over ideal lattices (ideal-SIVP).* Some efficiency improvements for FHE.} While the new blueprint does not yet improve computational efficiency, it reduces cipher text length. As in the previous blueprint, we obtain pure FHE by assuming circular security. Our main technique is to express the decryption function of SWHE schemes as a depth-3 ($\\sum \\prod \\sum$) arithmetic circuit. When we evaluate this decryption function homomorphically, we temporarily switch to a multiplicatively homomorphic encryption (MHE) scheme, such as Elgamal, to handle the $\\prod$ part, after which we translate the result from the MHE scheme back to the SWHE scheme by evaluating the MHE scheme's decryption function within the SWHE scheme. The SWHE scheme only needs to be able to evaluate the MHE scheme's decryption function (plus minor operations), and does not need to have the self-referential property of being able to evaluate its {\\em own} decryption function, a property that necessitated squashing in the original blueprint.",

      "abstract": "Recent exploration into the unique security challenges of cloud computing have shown that when virtual machines belonging to different customers share the same physical machine, new forms of cross-VM covert channel communication arise. In this paper, we explore one of these threats, L2 cache covert channels, and demonstrate the limits of these this threat by providing a quantification of the channel bit rates and an assessment of its ability to do harm. Through progressively refining models of cross-VM covert channels from the derived maximums, to implementable channels in the lab, and finally in Amazon EC2 itself we show how a variety of factors impact our ability to create effective channels. While we demonstrate a covert channel with considerably higher bit rate than previously reported, we assess that even at such improved rates, the harm of data exfiltration from these channels is still limited to the sharing of small, if important, secrets such as private keys.",

Recently, a number of protocols have been proposed for the efficient construction of two-party computation secure in the presence of malicious adversaries (where security is proven under the standard simulation-based ideal/real model paradigm for defining security). In this paper, we present a protocol for this task that follows the methodology of using cut-and-choose to boost Yao’s protocol to be secure in the presence of malicious adversaries. Relying on specific assumptions (DDH), we construct a protocol that is significantly more efficient and far simpler than the protocol of Lindell and Pinkas (Eurocrypt 2007) that follows the same methodology. We provide an exact, concrete analysis of the efficiency of our scheme and demonstrate that (at least for not very small circuits) our protocol is more efficient than any other known today.",

The slow key generation process of the Smart–Vercauteren system was then addressed in a paper by Gentry and Halevi, but their key generation method appears to exclude the SIMD style operation alluded to by Smart and Vercauteren. In this paper, we show how to select parameters to enable such SIMD operations. As such, we obtain a somewhat homomorphic scheme supporting both SIMD operations and operations on large finite fields of characteristic two. This somewhat homomorphic scheme can be made fully homomorphic in a naive way by recrypting all data elements separately. However, we show that the SIMD operations can be used to perform the recrypt procedure in parallel, resulting in a substantial speed-up. Finally, we demonstrate how such SIMD operations can be used to perform various tasks by studying two use cases: implementing AES homomorphically and encrypted database lookup.",

The protocol may be used to compute securely arithmetic circuits over any finite field $$\\mathbb {F}_{p^k}$$. Our protocol consists of a preprocessing phase that is both independent of the function to be computed and of the inputs, and a much more efficient online phase where the actual computation takes place. The online phase is unconditionally secure and has total computational and communication complexity linear in n, the number of players, where earlier work was quadratic in n. Moreover, the work done by each player is only a small constant factor larger than what one would need to compute the circuit in the clear. We show this is optimal for computation in large fields. In practice, for 3 players, a secure 64-bit multiplication can be done in 0.05 ms. Our preprocessing is based on a somewhat homomorphic cryptosystem. We extend a scheme by Brakerski et al., so that we can perform distributed decryption and handle many values in parallel in one ciphertext. The computational complexity of our preprocessing phase is dominated by the public-key operations, we need $$On^2/s$$ operations per secure multiplication where s is a parameter that increases with the security parameter of the cryptosystem. Earlier work in this model needed $$\\varOmega n^2$$ operations. In practice, the preprocessing prepares a secure 64-bit multiplication for 3 players in about 13 ms.",

      "abstract": "Cloud storage systems are becoming increasingly popular. A promising technology that keeps their cost down is deduplication, which stores only a single copy of repeating data. Client-side deduplication attempts to identify deduplication opportunities already at the client and save the bandwidth of uploading copies of existing files to the server. In this work we identify attacks that exploit client-side deduplication, allowing an attacker to gain access to arbitrary-size files of other users based on a very small hash signatures of these files. More specifically, an attacker who knows the hash signature of a file can convince the storage service that it owns that file, hence the server lets the attacker download the entire file. (In parallel to our work, a subset of these attacks were recently introduced in the wild with respect to the Dropbox file synchronization service.) To overcome such attacks, we introduce the notion of proofs-of-ownership (PoWs), which lets a client efficiently prove to a server that that the client holds a file, rather than just some short information about it. We formalize the concept of proof-of-ownership, under rigorous security definitions, and rigorous efficiency requirements of Petabyte scale storage systems. We then present solutions based on Merkle trees and specific encodings, and analyze their security. We implemented one variant of the scheme. Our performance measurements indicate that the scheme incurs only a small overhead compared to naive client-side deduplication.",

Furthermore, the modified protocol is actually a succinct non-interactive adaptive argument of knowledge (SNARK). We then propose several candidate constructions for ECRHs and relaxations thereof.\n We demonstrate the applicability of SNARKs to various forms of delegation of computation, to succinct non-interactive zero knowledge arguments, and to succinct two-party secure computation.

In this notion that we call on-the-fly multiparty computation (MPC), the cloud can non-interactively perform arbitrary, dynamically chosen computations on data belonging to arbitrary sets of users chosen on-the-fly. All user's input data and intermediate results are protected from snooping by the cloud as well as other users. This extends the standard notion of fully homomorphic encryption (FHE), where users can only enlist the cloud's help in evaluating functions on their own encrypted data.\n In on-the-fly MPC, each user is involved only when initially uploading his (encrypted) data to the cloud, and in a final output decryption phase when outputs are revealed; the complexity of both is independent of the function being computed and the total number of users in the system. When users upload their data, they need not decide in advance which function will be computed, nor who they will compute with; they need only retroactively approve the eventually-chosen functions and on whose data the functions were evaluated.\n This notion is qualitatively the best possible in minimizing interaction, since the users' interaction in the decryption stage is inevitable: we show that removing it would imply generic program obfuscation and is thus impossible.\n Our contributions are two-fold:- We show how on-the-fly MPC can be achieved using a new type of encryption scheme that we call multikey FHE, which is capable of operating on inputs encrypted under multiple, unrelated keys. A ciphertext resulting from a multikey evaluation can be jointly decrypted using the secret keys of all the users involved in the computation. - We construct a multikey FHE scheme based on NTRU, a very efficient public-key encryption scheme proposed in the 1990s. It was previously not known how to make NTRU fully homomorphic even for a single party. We view the construction of (multikey) FHE from NTRU encryption as a main contribution of independent interest. Although the transformation to a fully homomorphic system deteriorates the efficiency of NTRU somewhat, we believe that this system is a leading candidate for a practical FHE scheme.",

This paper explores the validity of that belief. We develop three classes of protocols targeted to different set sizes and domains, all based on Yao’s generic garbled-circuit method. We then compare the performance of our protocols to the fastest custom PSI protocols in the literature. Our results show that a careful application of garbled circuits leads to solutions that can run on million-element sets on typical desktops, and that can be competitive with the fastest custom protocols.

We address the algorithmic problem of finding a set of k initial seed nodes in a network so that the expected size of the resulting cascade is maximized, under the standard independent cascade model of network diffusion. Runtime is a primary consideration for this problem due to the massive size of the relevant input networks. \nWe provide a fast algorithm for the influence maximization problem, obtaining the near-optimal approximation factor of (1 - 1/e - epsilon), for any epsilon > 0, in time O((m+n)k log(n) / epsilon^2). Our algorithm is runtime-optimal (up to a logarithmic factor) and substantially improves upon the previously best-known algorithms which run in time Omega(mnk POLY(1/epsilon)). Furthermore, our algorithm can be modified to allow early termination: if it is terminated after O(beta(m+n)k log(n)) steps for some beta < 1 (which can depend on n), then it returns a solution with approximation factor O(beta). Finally, we show that this runtime is optimal (up to logarithmic factors) for any beta and fixed seed size k.",

Obfuscators, if they exist, would have a wide variety of cryptographic and complexity-theoretic applications, ranging from software protection to homomorphic encryption to complexity-theoretic analogues of Rice's theorem. Most of these applications are based on an interpretation of the “unintelligibility” condition in obfuscation as meaning that <i>O</i>(<i>P</i>) is a “virtual black box,” in the sense that anything one can efficiently compute given <i>O</i>(<i>P</i>), one could also efficiently compute given oracle access to <i>P</i>.\n In this work, we initiate a theoretical investigation of obfuscation. Our main result is that, even under very weak formalizations of the above intuition, obfuscation is impossible. We prove this by constructing a family of efficient programs <i>P</i> that are <i>unobfuscatable</i> in the sense that (a) given <i>any</i> efficient program <i>P</i>' that computes the same function as a program <i>P</i> ∈ <i>p</i>, the “source code” <i>P</i> can be efficiently reconstructed, yet (b) given <i>oracle access</i> to a (randomly selected) program <i>P</i> ∈ <i>p</i>, no efficient algorithm can reconstruct <i>P</i> (or even distinguish a certain bit in the code from random) except with negligible probability.\n We extend our impossibility result in a number of ways, including even obfuscators that (a) are not necessarily computable in polynomial time, (b) only approximately preserve the functionality, and (c) only need to work for very restricted models of computation (<b>TC<sup>0</sup></b>).

Even though more than a dozen schemes were proposed, all these schemes leak more information than order. This paper presents the first order-preserving scheme that achieves ideal security. Our main technique is mutable ciphertexts, meaning that over time, the ciphertexts for a small number of plaintext values change, and we prove that mutable ciphertexts are needed for ideal security. Our resulting protocol is interactive, with a small number of interactions. We implemented our scheme and evaluated it on microbenchmarks and in the context of an encrypted MySQL database application.

This construction yields, in particular, punctured pseudorandom functions, which have proven an invaluable tool in recent advances in obfuscation Sahai and Waters ePrint 2013.",

      "abstract": "Bit coin is a decentralized digital currency, introduced in 2008, that has recently gained noticeable popularity. Its main features are: (a) it lacks a central authority that controls the transactions, (b) the list of transactions is publicly available, and (c) its syntax allows more advanced transactions than simply transferring the money. The goal of this paper is to show how these properties of Bit coin can be used in the area of secure multiparty computation protocols (MPCs). Firstly, we show that the Bit coin system provides an attractive way to construct a version of \"timed commitments\", where the committer has to reveal his secret within a certain time frame, or to pay a fine. This, in turn, can be used to obtain fairness in some multiparty protocols. Secondly, we introduce a concept of multiparty protocols that work \"directly on Bit coin\". Recall that the standard definition of the MPCs guarantees only that the protocol \"emulates the trusted third party\". Hence ensuring that the inputs are correct, and the outcome is respected is beyond the scope of the definition. Our observation is that the Bit coin system can be used to go beyond the standard \"emulation-based\" definition, by constructing protocols that link their inputs and the outputs with the real Bit coin transactions. As an instantiation of this idea we construct protocols for secure multiparty lotteries using the Bit coin currency, without relying on a trusted authority (one of these protocols uses the Bit coin-based timed commitments mentioned above). Our protocols guarantee fairness for the honest parties no matter how the loser behaves. For example: if one party interrupts the protocol then her money is transferred to the honest participants. Our protocols are practical (to demonstrate it we performed their transactions in the actual Bit coin system), and can be used in real life as a replacement for the online gambling sites. We think that this paradigm can have also other applications. We discuss some of them.",

One of the primary techniques for achieving efficient secure two-party computation is that of Yao’s garbled circuits (FOCS 1986). In the semi-honest model, where just one garbled circuit is constructed and evaluated, Yao’s protocol has proven itself to be very efficient. However, a malicious adversary who constructs the garbled circuit may construct a garbling of a different circuit computing a different function, and this cannot be detected (due to the garbling). In order to solve this problem, many circuits are sent and some of them are opened to check that they are correct while the others are evaluated. This methodology, called cut-and-choose, introduces significant overhead, both in computation and in communication, and is mainly due to the number of circuits that must be used in order to prevent cheating.",

We use this technique to carry out a systematic study of the applicability of indistinguishability obfuscation to a variety of cryptographic goals. Along the way, we resolve the 16-year-old open question of Deniable Encryption, posed by Canetti, Dwork, Naor, and Ostrovsky in 1997: In deniable encryption, a sender who is forced to reveal to an adversary both her message and the randomness she used for encrypting it should be able to convincingly provide \"fake\" randomness that can explain any alternative message that she would like to pretend that she sent. We resolve this question by giving the first construction of deniable encryption that does not require any pre-planning by the party that must later issue a denial.\n In addition, we show the generality of our punctured programs technique by also constructing a variety of core cryptographic objects from indistinguishability obfuscation and one-way functions (or close variants). In particular we obtain: public key encryption, short \"hash-and-sign\" selectively secure signatures, chosen-ciphertext secure public key encryption, non-interactive zero knowledge proofs (NIZKs), injective trapdoor functions, and oblivious transfer. These results suggest the possibility of indistinguishability obfuscation becoming a \"central hub\" for cryptography.",

Should clients conventionally encrypt their files, however, savings are lost. Message-locked encryption (the most prominent manifestation of which is convergent encryption) resolves this tension. However it is inherently subject to brute-force attacks that can recover files falling into a known set. We propose an architecture that provides secure deduplicated storage resisting brute-force attacks, and realize it in a system called DupLESS. In DupLESS, clients encrypt under message-based keys obtained from a key-server via an oblivious PRF protocol. It enables clients to store encrypted data with an existing service, have the service perform deduplication on their behalf, and yet achieves strong confidentiality guarantees. We show that encryption for deduplicated storage can achieve performance and space savings close to that of using the storage service with plaintext data.",

In a graph-induced multilinear encoding scheme the arithmetic operations that are allowed are restricted through an explicitly defined directed graph (somewhat similar to the “asymmetric variant” of previous schemes). Our construction encodes Learning With Errors (LWE) samples in short square matrices of higher dimensions.

At the basis of these constructions is a new library of building blocks, which enables constructing a wide range of privacy-preserving classifiers; we demonstrate how this library can be used to construct other classifiers than the three mentioned above, such as a multiplexer and a face detection classifier.

As sophisticated algorithms for predictive analysis on medical data continue to be developed, it is likely that, in the future, more and more computation will be done on private patient data. While encryption provides a tool for assuring the privacy of medical information, it limits the functionality for operating on such data. Conventional encryption methods used today provide only very restricted possibilities or none at all to operate on encrypted data without decrypting it first. Homomorphic encryption provides a tool for handling such computations on encrypted data, without decrypting the data, and without even needing the decryption key. In this paper, we discuss possible application scenarios for homomorphic encryption in order to ensure privacy of sensitive medical data. We describe how to privately conduct predictive analysis tasks on encrypted data using homomorphic encryption. As a proof of concept, we present a working implementation of a prediction service running in the cloud (hosted on Microsoft's Windows Azure), which takes as input private encrypted health data, and returns the probability for suffering cardiovascular disease in encrypted form. Since the cloud service uses homomorphic encryption, it makes this prediction while handling only encrypted data, learning nothing about the submitted confidential medical data.",

      "abstract": "The well-known classical constructions of garbled circuits use four ciphertexts per gate, although various methods have been proposed to reduce this cost. The best previously known methods for optimizing AND gates (two ciphertexts; Pinkas et al., ASIACRYPT 2009) and XOR gates (zero ciphertexts; Kolesnikov and Schneider, ICALP 2008) were incompatible, so most implementations used the best known method compatible with free-XOR gates (three ciphertexts; Kolesnikov and Schneider, ICALP 2008). In this work we show how to simultaneously garble AND gates using two ciphertexts and XOR gates using zero ciphertexts, resulting in smaller garbled circuits than any prior scheme. The main idea behind our construction is to break an AND gate into two half-gates — AND gates for which one party knows one input. Each half-gate can be garbled with a single ciphertext, so our construction uses two ciphertexts for each AND gate while being compatible with free-XOR gates. The price for the reduction in size is that the evaluator must perform two cryptographic operations per AND gate, rather than one as in previous schemes. We experimentally demonstrate that our garbling scheme leads to an overall decrease in time (up to 25%), bandwidth (up to 33%), and energy use (up to 20%) over several benchmark applications. We show that our construction is optimal for a large class of garbling schemes encompassing all known practical garbling techniques.",

However, there is a fundamental disconnect between the theoretical results and the practice of data analysis: the theory of statistical inference assumes a fixed collection of hypotheses to be tested, or learning algorithms to be applied, selected non-adaptively before the data are gathered, whereas in practice data is shared and reused with hypotheses and new analyses being generated on the basis of data exploration and the outcomes of previous analyses.\n In this work we initiate a principled study of how to guarantee the validity of statistical inference in adaptive data analysis. As an instance of this problem, we propose and investigate the question of estimating the expectations of m adaptively chosen functions on an unknown distribution given n random samples.\n We show that, surprisingly, there is a way to estimate an exponential in n number of expectations accurately even if the functions are chosen adaptively. This gives an exponential improvement over standard empirical estimators that are limited to a linear number of estimates. Our result follows from a general technique that counter-intuitively involves actively perturbing and coordinating the estimates, using techniques developed for privacy preservation. We give additional applications of this technique to our question.",

      "abstract": "The decentralized currency network Bitcoin is emerging as a potential new way of performing financial transactions across the globe. Its use of pseudonyms towards protecting users' privacy has been an attractive feature to many of its adopters. Nevertheless, due to the inherent public nature of the Bitcoin transaction ledger, users' privacy is severely restricted to linkable anonymity, and a few transaction deanonymization attacks have been reported thus far. \n \nIn this paper we propose CoinShuffle, a completely decentralized Bitcoin mixing protocol that allows users to utilize Bitcoin in a truly anonymous manner. CoinShuffle is inspired by the accountable anonymous group communication protocol Dissent and enjoys several advantages over its predecessor Bitcoin mixing protocols. It does not require any trusted, accountable or untrusted third party and it is perfectly compatible with the current Bitcoin system. CoinShuffle introduces only a small communication overhead for its users, while completely avoiding additional anonymization fees and minimalizing the computation and communication overhead for the rest of the Bitcoin system.",

      "abstract": "In distributed reflective denial-of-service (DRDoS) attacks, adversaries send requests to public servers (e.g., open recursive DNS resolvers) and spoof the IP address of a victim. These servers, in turn, flood the victim with valid responses and – unknowingly – exhaust its bandwidth. Recently, attackers launched DRDoS attacks with hundreds of Gb/s bandwidth of this kind. While the attack technique is well-known for a few protocols such as DNS, it is unclear if further protocols are vulnerable to similar or worse attacks. In this paper, we revisit popular UDP-based protocols of network services, online games, P2P filesharing networks and P2P botnets to assess their security against DRDoS abuse. We find that 14 protocols are susceptible to bandwidth amplification and multiply the traffic up to a factor 4670. In the worst case, attackers thus need only 0.02% of the bandwidth that they want their victim(s) to receive, enabling far more dangerous attacks than what is known today. Worse, we identify millions of public hosts that can be abused as amplifiers. We then analyze more than 130 real-world DRDoS attacks. For this, we announce bait services to monitor their abuse and analyze darknet as well as network traffic from large ISPs. We use traffic analysis to detect both, victims and amplifiers, showing that attackers already started to abuse vulnerable protocols other than DNS. Lastly, we evaluate countermeasures against DRDoS attacks, such as preventing spoofing or hardening protocols and service configurations. We shows that carefully-crafted DRDoS attacks may evade poorly-designed rate limiting solutions. In addition, we show that some attacks evade packet-based filtering techniques, such as port-, contentor length-based filters.",

      "abstract": "Bit coin is the first digital currency to see widespread adoption. While payments are conducted between pseudonyms, Bit coin cannot offer strong privacy guarantees: payment transactions are recorded in a public decentralized ledger, from which much information can be deduced. Zero coin (Miers et al., IEEE S&P 2013) tackles some of these privacy issues by unlinking transactions from the payment's origin. Yet, it still reveals payments' destinations and amounts, and is limited in functionality. In this paper, we construct a full-fledged ledger-based digital currency with strong privacy guarantees. Our results leverage recent advances in zero-knowledge Succinct Non-interactive Arguments of Knowledge (zk-SNARKs). First, we formulate and construct decentralized anonymous payment schemes (DAP schemes). A DAP scheme enables users to directly pay each other privately: the corresponding transaction hides the payment's origin, destination, and transferred amount. We provide formal definitions and proofs of the construction's security. Second, we build Zero cash, a practical instantiation of our DAP scheme construction. In Zero cash, transactions are less than 1 kB and take under 6 ms to verify - orders of magnitude more efficient than the less-anonymous Zero coin and competitive with plain Bit coin.",

In the event of contractual breaches or aborts, the decentralized blockchain ensures that honest parties obtain commensurate compensation. Existing systems, however, lack transactional privacy. All transactions, including flow of money between pseudonyms and amount transacted, are exposed on the blockchain. We present Hawk, a decentralized smart contract system that does not store financial transactions in the clear on the blockchain, thus retaining transactional privacy from the public's view. A Hawk programmer can write a private smart contract in an intuitive manner without having to implement cryptography, and our compiler automatically generates an efficient cryptographic protocol where contractual parties interact with the blockchain, using cryptographic primitives such as zero-knowledge proofs. To formally define and reason about the security of our protocols, we are the first to formalize the blockchain model of cryptography. The formal modeling is of independent interest. We advocate the community to adopt such a formal model when designing applications atop decentralized blockchains.",

In this model, individual users randomize their data themselves, sending differentially private reports to an untrusted server that aggregates them. We study protocols that produce a succinct histogram representation of the data. A succinct histogram is a list of the most frequent items in the data (often called \"heavy hitters\") along with estimates of their frequencies; the frequency of all other items is implicitly estimated as 0.\n If there are n users whose items come from a universe of size d, our protocols run in time polynomial in n and log(d). With high probability, they estimate the accuracy of every item up to error O(√{log(d)/(ε2n)}). Moreover, we show that this much error is necessary, regardless of computational efficiency, and even for the simple setting where only one item appears with significant frequency in the data set.\n Previous protocols (Mishra and Sandler, 2006; Hsu, Khanna and Roth, 2012) for this task either ran in time Ω(d) or had much worse error (about √[6]{log(d)/(ε2n)}), and the only known lower bound on error was Ω(1/√{n}).\n We also adapt a result of McGregor et al (2010) to the local setting.

      "abstract": "In this work we study interactive proofs for tractable languages. The (honest) prover should be efficient and run in polynomial time or, in other words, a “muggle”.1 The verifier should be super-efficient and run in nearly linear time. These proof systems can be used for delegating computation: a server can run a computation for a client and interactively prove the correctness of the result. The client can verify the result’s correctness in nearly linear time (instead of running the entire computation itself).\n Previously, related questions were considered in the holographic proof setting by Babai et al. [1991b] in the argument setting under computational assumptions by Kilian, and in the random oracle model by Micali [1994]. Our focus, however, is on the original interactive proof model where no assumptions are made on the computational power or adaptiveness of dishonest provers.\n Our main technical theorem gives a public coin interactive proof for any language computable by a log-space uniform boolean circuit with depth d and input length n. The verifier runs in time n · poly(d, log(n)) and space O(log(n)), the communication complexity is poly(d, log(n)), and the prover runs in time poly(n). In particular, for languages computable by log-space uniform NC (circuits of polylog(n) depth), the prover is efficient, the verifier runs in time n · polylog(n) and space O(log(n)), and the communication complexity is polylog(n). Using this theorem we make progress on several questions.\n --- We show how to construct 1-round computationally sound arguments with polylog communication for any log-space uniform NC computation. The verifier runs in quasi-linear time. This result uses a recent transformation of Kalai and Raz from public coin interactive proofs to 1-round arguments. The soundness of the argument system is based on the existence of a PIR scheme with polylog communication.\n --- We construct interactive proofs with public coin, log-space, poly-time verifiers for all of P are given. This settles an open question regarding the expressive power of proof systems with such verifiers.\n --- We construct zero-knowledge interactive proofs are given with communication complexity quasi-linear in the witness length for any NP language verifiable in NC, based on the existence of 1-way functions.\n --- We construct probabilistically checkable arguments (a model due to Kalai and Raz) of size polynomial in the witness length (rather than instance length) for any NP language verifiable in NC, under computational assumptions, are provided.",

Two of the most popular cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum, support the feature to encode rules or scripts for processing transactions. This feature has evolved to give practical shape to the ideas of smart contracts, or full-fledged programs that are run on blockchains. Recently, Ethereum's smart contract system has seen steady adoption, supporting tens of thousands of contracts, holding millions dollars worth of virtual coins.\n In this paper, we investigate the security of running smart contracts based on Ethereum in an open distributed network like those of cryptocurrencies. We introduce several new security problems in which an adversary can manipulate smart contract execution to gain profit. These bugs suggest subtle gaps in the understanding of the distributed semantics of the underlying platform. As a refinement, we propose ways to enhance the operational semantics of Ethereum to make contracts less vulnerable. For developers writing contracts for the existing Ethereum system, we build a symbolic execution tool called Oyente to find potential security bugs. Among 19, 336 existing Ethereum contracts, Oyente flags 8, 833 of them as vulnerable, including the TheDAO bug which led to a 60 million US dollar loss in June 2016. We also discuss the severity of other attacks for several case studies which have source code available and confirm the attacks (which target only our accounts) in the main Ethereum network.",

      "abstract": "Lattice-based cryptography offers some of the most attractive primitives believed to be resistant to quantum computers. Following increasing interest from both companies and government agencies in building quantum computers, a number of works have proposed instantiations of practical post-quantum key exchange protocols based on hard problems in ideal lattices, mainly based on the Ring Learning With Errors (R-LWE) problem. While ideal lattices facilitate major efficiency and storage benefits over their non-ideal counterparts, the additional ring structure that enables these advantages also raises concerns about the assumed difficulty of the underlying problems. Thus, a question of significant interest to cryptographers, and especially to those currently placing bets on primitives that will withstand quantum adversaries, is how much of an advantage the additional ring structure actually gives in practice. Despite conventional wisdom that generic lattices might be too slow and unwieldy, we demonstrate that LWE-based key exchange is quite practical: our constant time implementation requires around 1.3ms computation time for each party; compared to the recent NewHope R-LWE scheme, communication sizes increase by a factor of 4.7x, but remain under 12 KiB in each direction. Our protocol is competitive when used for serving web pages over TLS; when partnered with ECDSA signatures, latencies increase by less than a factor of 1.6x, and (even under heavy load) server throughput only decreases by factors of 1.5x and 1.2x when serving typical 1 KiB and 100 KiB pages, respectively. To achieve these practical results, our protocol takes advantage of several innovations. These include techniques to optimize communication bandwidth, dynamic generation of public parameters (which also offers additional security against backdoors), carefully chosen error distributions, and tight security parameters.",

Threshold schemes, however, can only handle a small fraction of the secret sharing functions which we may wish to form. For example, if it is desirable to divide a secret among four participants A, B, C, and D in such a way that either A together with B can reconstruct the secret or C together with D can reconstruct the secret, then threshold schemes (even with weighting) are provably insufficient.This paper will present general methods for constructing secret sharing schemes for any given secret sharing function. There is a natural correspondence between the set of \"generalized\" secret sharing functions and the set of monotone functions, and tools developed for simplifying the latter set can be applied equally well to the former set.",

When the k people have finished signing (authenticating), nobody can perform an impersonation or substitution attack. These schemes are called threshold signature (authentication) schemes. Clearly these schemes are better than each of the k individuals sending a separate authenticator for each message or if each of the k individuals each send their share to a \"trusted\" person who will sign for them.In all of the schemes we assume that the shareholders (senders) and receiver have secure workstations but the network and servers are not necessarily secure.",

      "abstract": "The difference between theory and practice often rests on one major factor: efficiency. In distributed systems, communication is usually expensive, and protocols designed for practical use must require as few rounds of communication and as small messages as possible.A secure multiparty protocol to compute function F is a protocol that, when each player i of n players starts with private input xi, provides each participant i with F(x1,...xn) without revealing more information than what can be derived from learning the function value. Some number l of players may be corrupted by an adversary who may then change the messages they send. Recent solutions to this problem have suffered in practical terms: while theoretically using only polynomially-many rounds, in practice the constants and exponents of such polynomials are too great. Normally, such protocols express F as a circuit CF, call on each player to secretly share xi, and proceed to perform \"secret addition and multiplication\" on secretly shared values. The cost is proportional to the depth of CF times the cost of secret multiplication; and multiplication requires several rounds of interaction.We present a protocol that simplifies the body of such a protocol and significantly reduces the number of rounds of interaction. The steps of our protocol take advantage of a new and counterintuitive technique for evaluating a circuit: set every input to every gate in the circuit completely at random, and then make corrections. Our protocol replaces each secret multiplication -- multiplication that requires further sharing, addition, zero-knowledge proofs, and secret reconstruction -- that is used during the body of a standard protocol by a simple reconstruction of secretly shared values, thereby reducing rounds by an order of magnitude. Furthermore, these reconstructions require only broadcast messages (but do not require Byzantine Agreement). The simplicity of broadcast and reconstruction provides efficiency and ease of implementation. Our transformation is simple and compatible with other techniques for reducing rounds.",

      "abstract": "The problem of secure multiparty computation is usually described as follows: each of n players in a network holds a private input xi. Together they would like to compute a function F(x1,...,xn) without revealing the inputs, even though no particular player can be trusted. Attempts to contrive formal definitions for the problem have treated properties of the solution separately (correctness, privacy, etc.), giving an ad hoc collection of desirable properties and varied definitions that do not support clear or comparable proofs.We propose a clear, concise, and unified definition for security and reliability in interactive computations. We develop a reduction called relative resilience that captures all desired properties at a single blow. Relative resilience allows one to classify and compare arbitrary protocols in terms of security and reliability, in the same way that Turing reductions allow one to classify and compare algorithms in terms of complexity. Security and reliability reduce to a simple statement: a protocol for F is resilient if it is as resilient as an ideal protocol in which a trusted host is available to compute F. Relative resilience captures the notions of security and reliability for a wide variety of interactive computations, including zero-knowledge proof systems, Byzantine Agreement, oblivious transfer, two-party oblivious circuit evaluation, among others.Relative resilience provides modular proof techniques that other approaches lack: one may compare a sequence of protocols ranging from the real-world protocol to the ideal protocol, proving the relative resilience of each successive protocol with greater clarity and less complexity. Folk theorems about the \"transitivity\" of security and the security of concatenated protocols are now provable; and the proofs reveal that such folk theorems fail under subtle conditions that have previously gone unnoticed. The conciseness and modularity of our definitions and proof techniques provide great clarity in designing and reasoning about protocols and have already lead to provably secure protocols that are significantly more efficient than those appearing in the literature.",

For instance, when a person conducts a cryptographic identification protocol at an entrance to a building, the access control computer in the building would like to be ensured that the person giving the responses is no more than a few meters away. The \"distance bounding\" technique we introduce solves this problem by timing the delay between sending out a challenge bit and receiving back the corresponding response bit. It can be integrated into common identification protocols. The technique can also be applied in the three-party setting of \"wallets with observers\" in such a way that the intermediary party can prevent the other two from exchanging information, or even developing common coinflips.",

However, the proof of this lower bound uses the notion of information theoretic secrecy. A natural (and very practical) question is whether one can do better for secret sharing if the notion of secrecy is computational, namely, against resource bounded adversaries. In this note we observe that, indeed, one can do much better in the computational model (which is the one used in most applications).We present an m-threshold scheme, where m shares recover the secret but m - 1 shares give no (computational) information on the secret, in which shares corresponding to a secret S are of size |S|/m plus a short piece of information whose length does not depend on the secret size but just in the security parameter. (The bound of |S|/m is clearly optimal if the secret is to be recovered from m shares). Therefore, for moderately large secrets (a confidential file, a long message, a large data base) the savings in space and communication over traditional schemes is remarkable.The scheme is very simple and combines in a natural way traditional (perfect) secret sharing schemes, encryption, and information dispersal. It is provable secure given a secure (e.g., private key) encryption function.",

We introduce and classify two definitions of zero-knowledge: auxiliary-input zero-knowledge and blackbox-simulation zero-knowledge. We explain why auxiliary-input zero-knowledge is a definition more suitable for cryptographic applications than the original [GMR1] definition. In particular, we show that any protocol solely composed of subprotocols which are auxiliary-input zero-knowledge is itself auxiliary-input zero-knowledge. We show that blackbox-simulation zero-knowledge implies auxiliary-input zero-knowledge (which in turn implies the [GMR1] definition). We argue that all known zero-knowledge proofs are in fact blackbox-simulation zero-knowledge (i.e., we proved zero-knowledge using blackbox-simulation of the verifier). As a result, all known zero-knowledge proof systems are shown to be auxiliary-input zero-knowledge and can be used for cryptographic applications such as those in [GMW2].We demonstrate the triviality of certain classes of zero-knowledge proof systems, in the sense that only languages in BPP have zero-knowledge proofs of these classes. In particular, we show that any language having a Las Vegas zero-knowledge proof system necessarily belongs to RP. We show that randomness of both the verifier and the prover, and nontriviality of the interaction are essential properties of (nontrivial) auxiliary-input zero-knowledge proofs.",

These constructions apply to both shared-key and public-key settings. Receiver-deniability from Sender-deniability. Assume a sender-deniable encryption scheme A, and construct the following scheme B. Let b denote the bit to be transmitted from S to R. First R chooses a random bit r, and invokes the scheme A to send r to S. (That is, with respect to scheme A, R is the sender and S is the receiver.) Next, S sends b r to R, in the clear. If scheme A is sender-deniable then, when attacked, R can convincingly claim that the value of r was either 0 or 1, as desired. Consequently R can claim that the bit b was either 0 or 1, at wish, and scheme B is receiver-deniable. Sender-deniability from Receiver-deniability. We use the exact same construction. It is easy to verify that if A is receiver-deniable then B is sender-deniable. Sender-and-receiver-deniability. Assume that S and R can use other parties I1; :::; In as intermediaries in their communication. The following scheme is resilient against attacking the sender, the receiver and some intermediaries, as long as at least one intermediary remains unattacked. In order to transmit a bit b to R, S rst chooses n bits b1:::bn such that ibi = b. Next, S transmits bi to each intermediary Ii, using a sender-deniable scheme. Next, each Ii transmits bi to R using a receiverdeniable scheme. Finally R computes ibi = b. When an intermediary Ii is attacked, it reveals the true value of bi. However, as long as one intermediary Ij remains unattacked, both S and R can convincingly claim, when attacked, that the value of bj (and consequently the value of b) is either 0 or 1. Note that this scheme works only if the parties can `coordinate their stories', in the sense of Remark 2 to De nition 10. In particular, the sender and receiver must know, when attacked, which intermediaries are being attacked.4 References [1] M. Ajtai, Generating Hard Instances of Lattice Problems, STOC'96 [2] M.

A An Alternative Non-Committing Encryption Scheme Recently, general multiparty protocols secure against an adaptive adversary that corrupts parties based on past information were constructed [7]. At the heart of this construction is another type of encryption protocol, called non-committing encryptions. As in the case of deniable encryption, non-committing encryption is concerned with foiling an adversary that registers the ciphertext and later asks the sender and receiver to reveal their secret keys and random choices. Non-committing encryption o ers a considerably weaker solution to this problem than deniable encryption, (although non-committing encryption su ce for proving adaptive security.) Very roughly, a non-committing encryption scheme consists of the usual key-generation, encryption, and decryption algorithms that ensure correctness and semantic security, with the following extra property: There exists a simulator that simulates the process of encryption and decryption in a deniable. That is, the simulator rst generates dummy ciphertexts that are indistinguishable, in the eyes of the adversary, from authentic 12 ciphertexts. Next, when the adversary asks to see the internal data of the sender and the receiver, the simulator is able to choose an arbitrary cleartext and then present the adversary with data that is consistent the chosen cleartext. Note that in a non-committing scheme only the simulator can generate `dummy ciphertexts' that can be `opened' as encryptions of more than one value. The sender and receiver are unable to do so. Furthermore, the dummy ciphertexts of a non-committing scheme need not have meaningful decryption, whereas in deniable encryption each ciphertext has unique, meaningful decryption and at the same time can be opened in several ways for an adversary. In particular the non-committing scheme described in [7] is not deniable. Any public-key (n)-sender-and-receiver-deniable encryption scheme according to De nition 10 is noncommitting if (n) is negligible. However, we do not know if such a deniable scheme exists. (In this paper we only describe 1 nc -sender-and-receiver-deniable schemes, we're c is a constant.) It turns out, however, that the basic scheme described in Section 3, after being transformed into a sender-and-receiver-deniable scheme using the technique of Section 6, is a valid non-committing encryption scheme. In particular, this scheme is much simpler to present and prove than the [7] scheme. Call this scheme the transformed basic scheme. To show that the transformed basic scheme is non-committing, we have to describe the simulator. We use the fact that, in the basic scheme, cheating is undetectable in one direction (except for negligible probability). That is, the sender can encrypt 1 and later claim that the encrypted bit was 0. The dummy ciphertexts generated by the simulator will all be legal encryptions of 1. When, in a simulated execution, the sender and receiver are asked to demonstrate their internal data they can show that the encrypted bit was either 0 or 1, as desired. B De nitions 9 and 10 De nition 9 A protocol with sender S and receiver R, and with security parameter n is a (n)-receiverdeniable encryption protocol if it satis es De nition 2, with the exception that the Deniability property is replaced as follows. Deniability: There exists an e cient faking algorithm having the following property with respect to any m1; m2 2 M . Let rS ; rR be uniformly chosen random inputs of S and R, respectively, let c = com (m1; rS; rR), and let ~ rR = (m1; rR; c;m2). Then, the random variables (m2; ~ rR; c) and (m2; rR;com (m2; rS; rR)) are (n)-close. De nition 10 A protocol with sender S and receiver R, and with security parameter n is a (n)-senderand-receiver-deniable encryption protocol if it satis es De nition 2, with the exception that the Deniability property is replaced as follows. Deniability: There exist two e cient faking algorithms S and R having the following property with respect to any m1; m2 2 M . Let rS ; rR be uniformly chosen random inputs of S and R, respectively, let c = com (m1; rS; rR), let ~ rS = S(m1; rS; c;m2), and let ~ rR = R(m1; rR; c;m2). Then, the random variables (m2; ~ rS; ~ rR; c) and (m2; rS; rR;com (m2; rS; rR)) are (n)-close. 13 Remarks: 1. Note that the requirement from a sender-and-receiver-deniable encryption protocol is stronger than requiring that the protocol be both sender-deniable and receiver-deniable. 2. De nition 10 does not address the following issue. In order for the sender and the receiver to convince an adversary that attacks both, the parties need to have `consistent stories'. That is, they both should claim the same (fake or true) value for the cleartext. We believe that this `coordination' issue should be treated separately. (Indeed, it is extensively treated in [5].) Note that this issue does not appear when only the sender or only the receiver are attacked. 14",

This means that the queries give each individual database no partial information (in the information theoretic or computational sense) on the identity of the item retrieved by the user. All known PIR schemes assume that the user knows the physical address of the sought item. This is usually not the case when accessing a public database that is not managed by the user. Such databases are typically presented with keywords, which are then internally translated (at the database end) to physical addresses, using an appropriate search structure (for example, a hash table or a binary tree). In this note we describe a simple, modular way to privately access data by keywords. It combines any conventional search structure with any underlying PIR scheme (including single server schemes). The transformation requires no modiication in the way that the search structure is maintained. Therefore the same database will support both private and regular (non private) searches.",

      "abstract": "Private information retrieval (PIR) schemes allow a user to retrieve the ith bit of an n-bit data string x, replicated in k?2 databases (in the information-theoretic setting) or in k?1 databases (in the computational setting), while keeping the value of i private. The main cost measure for such a scheme is its communication complexity. In this paper we introduce a model of symmetrically-private information retrieval (SPIR), where the privacy of the data, as well as the privacy of the user, is guaranteed. That is, in every invocation of a SPIR protocol, the user learns only a single physical bit of x and no other information about the data. Previously known PIR schemes severely fail to meet this goal. We show how to transform PIR schemes into SPIR schemes (with information-theoretic privacy), paying a constant factor in communication complexity. To this end, we introduce and utilize a new cryptographic primitive, called conditional disclosure of secrets, which we believe may be a useful building block for the design of other cryptographic protocols. In particular, we get a k-database SPIR scheme of complexity O(n1/(2k?1)) for every constant k?2 and an O(logn)-database SPIR scheme of complexity O(log2n·loglogn). All our schemes require only a single round of interaction, and are resilient to any dishonest behavior of the user. These results also yield the first implementation of a distributed version of (n1)-OT (1-out-of-n oblivious transfer) with information-theoretic security and sublinear communication complexity.",

We also show that a wide range of known efficient proofs of knowledge using specialized assumptions can be modified to work in this model with no essential loss of efficiency. We argue that the assumptions of the model will be satisfied in many practical scenarios where public key cryptography is used, in particular our construction works given any secure public key infrastructure. Finally, we point out that in a model with preprocessing (and no auxiliary string) proposed earlier, concurrent zero-knowledge for NP can be based on any one-way function.",

      "abstract": "In this paper we formalize the notion of a ring signature, which makes it possible to specify a set of possible signers without revealing which member actually produced the signature. Unlike group signatures, ring signatures have no group managers, no setup procedures, no revocation procedures, and no coordination: any user can choose any set of possible signers that includes himself, and sign any message by using his secret key and the others' public keys, without getting their approval or assistance. Ring signatures provide an elegant way to leak authoritative secrets in an anonymous way, to sign casual email in a way which can only be verified by its intended recipient, and to solve other problems in multiparty computations. The main contribution of this paper is a new construction of such signatures which is unconditionally signer-ambiguous, provably secure in the random oracle model, and exceptionally efficient: adding each ring member increases the cost of signing or verifying by a single modular multiplication and a single symmetric encryption.",

      "abstract": "An aggregate signature scheme is a digital signature that supports aggregation: Given n signatures on n distinct messages from n distinct users, it is possible to aggregate all these signatures into a single short signature. This single signature (and the n original messages) will convince the verifier that the n users did indeed sign the n original messages (i.e., user i signed message Mi for i = 1, . . . , n). In this paper we introduce the concept of an aggregate signature, present security models for such signatures, and give several applications for aggregate signatures. We construct an efficient aggregate signature from a recent short signature scheme based on bilinear maps due to Boneh, Lynn, and Shacham. Aggregate signatures are useful for reducing the size of certificate chains (by aggregating all signatures in the chain) and for reducing message size in secure routing protocols such as SBGP. We also show that aggregate signatures give rise to verifiably encrypted signatures. Such signatures enable the verifier to test that a given ciphertext C is the encryption of a signature on a given message M. Verifiably encrypted signatures are used in contract-signing protocols. Finally, we show that similar ideas can be used to extend the short signature scheme to give simple ring signatures.",

In this paper, we address two important issues of a PEKS scheme, \"removing secure channel\" and \"refreshing keywords\", which have not been considered in Boneh et al.'s paper. We point out the inefficiency of the original PEKS scheme due to the use of the secure channel. We resolve this problem by constructing an efficient PEKS scheme that removes a secure channel. We then argue that care must be taken when keywords are used frequently in the PEKS scheme as this situation might contradict the security of PEKS.",

      "abstract": "We present two provably secure and efficient schemes for performing conjunctive keyword searches over symmetrically encrypted data. Our first scheme is based on Shamir Secret Sharing and provides the most efficient search technique in this context to date. Although the size of its trapdoors is linear in the number of documents being searched, we empirically show that this overhead remains reasonable in practice. Nonetheless, to address this limitation we provide an alternative based on bilinear pairings that yields constant size trapdoors. This latter construction is not only asymptotically more efficient than previous secure conjunctive keyword search schemes in the symmetric setting, but incurs significantly less storage overhead. Additionally, unlike most previous work, our constructions are proven secure in the standard model.",

      "abstract": "We continue a line of research initiated in [10, 11] on privacy-preserving statistical databases. Consider a trusted server that holds a database of sensitive information. Given a query function f mapping databases to reals, the so-called true answer is the result of applying f to the database. To protect privacy, the true answer is perturbed by the addition of random noise generated according to a carefully chosen distribution, and this response, the true answer plus noise, is returned to the user. Previous work focused on the case of noisy sums, in which f = Σ i g(x i ), where x i denotes the ith row of the database and g maps database rows to [0,1]. We extend the study to general functions f, proving that privacy can be preserved by calibrating the standard deviation of the noise according to the sensitivity of the function f. Roughly speaking, this is the amount that any single argument to f can change its output. The new analysis shows that for several particular applications substantially less noise is needed than was previously understood to be the case. The first step is a very clean characterization of privacy in terms of indistinguishability of transcripts. Additionally, we obtain separation results showing the increased value of interactive sanitization mechanisms over non-interactive.",

However, current modeling of security in the presence of such set-up falls short of providing the expected security guarantees. A quintessential example of this phenomenon is the deniability concern: there exist natural protocols that meet the strongest known composable security notions, and are still vulnerable to bad interactions with rogue protocols that use the same set-up. \n \nWe extend the notion of universally composable (UC) security in a way that re-establishes its original intuitive guarantee even for protocols that use globally available set-up. The new formulation prevents bad interactions even with adaptively chosen protocols that use the same set-up. In particular, it guarantees deniability. While for protocols that use no setup the proposed requirements are the same as in traditional UC security, for protocols that use global set-up the proposed requirements are significantly stronger. In fact, realizing Zero Knowledge or commitment becomes provably impossible, even in the Common Reference String model. Still, we propose reasonable alternative set-up assumptions and protocols that allow realizing practically any cryptographic task under standard hardness assumptions even against adaptive corruptions.",

Obfuscation has applications for cryptography and for software protection. \n \nBarak et al. initiated a theoretical study of obfuscation, which focused on black-box obfuscation, where the obfuscated circuit should leak no information except for its (black-box) input-output functionality. A family of functionalities that cannot be obfuscated was demonstrated. Subsequent research has showed further negative results as well as positive results for obfuscating very specific families of circuits, all with respect to black box obfuscation. \n \nThis work is a study of a new notion of obfuscation, which we call best-possible obfuscation. Best possible obfuscation makes the relaxed requirement that the obfuscated program leaks as little information as any other program with the same functionality (and of similar size). In particular, this definition allows the program to leak non black-box information. Best-possible obfuscation guarantees that any information that is not hidden by the obfuscated program is also not hidden by any other similar-size program computing the same functionality, and thus the obfuscation is (literally) the best possible. In this work we study best-possible obfuscation and its relationship to previously studied definitions. Our main results are: 1. A separation between black-box and best-possible obfuscation. We show a natural obfuscation task that can be achieved under the best-possible definition, but cannot be achieved under the black-box definition. 2. A hardness result for best-possible obfuscation, showing that strong (information-theoretic) best-possible obfuscation implies a collapse in the polynomial hierarchy. 3. An impossibility result for efficient best-possible (and black-box) obfuscation in the presence of random oracles. This impossibility result uses a random oracle to construct hard-to-obfuscate circuits, and thus it does not imply impossibility in the standard model.",

The computation should be carried out in a secure way, meaning that no coalition of corrupted parties should be able to learn more than specified or somehow cause the result to be \"incorrect\". Typically, corrupted parties are either assumed to be semi-honest (meaning that they follow the protocol specification) or malicious (meaning that they may deviate arbitrarily from the protocol). However, in many settings, the assumption regarding semi-honest behavior does not suffice and security in the presence of malicious adversaries is excessive and expensive to achieve. \n \nIn this paper, we introduce the notion of covert adversaries, which we believe faithfully models the adversarial behavior in many commercial, political, and social settings. Covert adversaries have the property that they may deviate arbitrarily from the protocol specification in an attempt to cheat, but do not wish to be \"caught\" doing so. We provide a definition of security for covert adversaries and show that it is possible to obtain highly efficient protocols that are secure against such adversaries. We stress that in our definition, we quantify over all (possibly malicious) adversaries and do not assume that the adversary behaves in any particular way.

In this case, we utilize specific properties of the Naor–Reingold pseudorandom function in order to achieve high efficiency.Our results are presented in two adversary models. Our protocol for secure pattern matching and one of our protocols for set intersection achieve security against malicious adversaries under a relaxed definition where one corruption case is simulatable and, for the other, only privacy (formalized through indistinguishability) is guaranteed. We also present a protocol for set intersection that is fully simulatable in the model of covert adversaries. Loosely speaking, this means that a malicious adversary can cheat but will then be caught with good probability.",

      "abstract": "Predicate encryption is a new encryption paradigm which gives a master secret key owner fine-grained control over access to encrypted data. The master secret key owner can generate secret key tokens corresponding to predicates. An encryption of data x can be evaluated using a secret token corresponding to a predicate f ; the user learns whether the data satisfies the predicate, i.e., whether f (x ) = 1. \n \nPrior work on public-key predicate encryption has focused on the notion of data or plaintext privacy, the property that ciphertexts reveal no information about the encrypted data to an attacker other than what is inherently revealed by the tokens the attacker possesses. In this paper, we consider a new notion called predicate privacy , the property that tokens reveal no information about the encoded query predicate. Predicate privacy is inherently impossible to achieve in the public-key setting and has therefore received little attention in prior work. In this work, we consider predicate encryption in the symmetric-key setting and present a symmetric-key predicate encryption scheme which supports inner product queries. We prove that our scheme achieves both plaintext privacy and predicate privacy.",

      "abstract": "In this work, we introduce one-time programs, a new computational paradigm geared towards security applications. A one-time program can be executed on a single input, whose value can be specified at run time. Other than the result of the computation on this input, nothing else about the program is leaked. Hence, a one-time program is like a black box function that may be evaluated once and then “self destructs.” This also extends to k-time programs, which are like black box functions that can be evaluated k times and then self destruct. One-time programs serve many of the same purposes of program obfuscation, the obvious one being software protection, but also including applications such as temporary transfer of cryptographic ability. Moreover, the applications of one-time programs go well beyond those of obfuscation, since one-time programs can only be executed once (or more generally, a limited number of times) while obfuscated programs have no such bounds. For example, one-time programs lead naturally to electronic cash or token schemes: coins are generated by a program that can only be run once, and thus cannot be double spent. Most significantly, the new paradigm of one-time computing opens new avenues for conceptual research. In this work we explore one such avenue, presenting the new concept of “one-time proofs,” proofs that can only be verified once and then become useless and unconvincing. All these tasks are clearly impossible using software alone, as any piece of software can be copied and run again, enabling the user to execute the program on more than one input. All our solutions employ a secure memory device, inspired by the cryptographic notion of interactive oblivious transfer protocols, that stores two secret keys (k0, k1). The device takes as input a single bit b ∈ {0, 1}, outputs kb, and then self destructs. Using such devices, we demonstrate that for every input length, any standard program (Turing machine) can be efficiently compiled into a functionally equivalent one-time program. We also show how this memory device can be used to construct one-time proofs. Specifically, we show how to use this device to efficiently convert a classical witness for any NP statement, into “one-time proof” for that statement. ?

      "abstract": "We present a new methodology for proving security of encryption systems using what we call Dual System Encryption. Our techniques result in fully secure Identity-Based Encryption (IBE) and Hierarchical Identity-Based Encryption (HIBE) systems under the simple and established decisional Bilinear Diffie-Hellman and decisional Linear assumptions. Our IBE system has ciphertexts, private keys, and public parameters each consisting of a constant number of group elements. These results are the first HIBE system and the first IBE system with short parameters under simple assumptions. \n \nIn a Dual System Encryption system both ciphertexts and private keys can take on one of two indistinguishable forms. A private key or ciphertext will be normal if they are generated respectively from the system's key generation or encryption algorithm. These keys and ciphertexts will behave as one expects in an IBE system. In addition, we define semi-functional keys and ciphertexts. A semi-functional private key will be able to decrypt all normally generated ciphertexts; however, decryption will fail if one attempts to decrypt a semi-functional ciphertext with a semi-functional private key. Analogously, semi-functional ciphertexts will be decryptable only by normal private keys. \n \nDual System Encryption opens up a new way to prove security of IBE and related encryption systems. We define a sequence of games where we change first the challenge ciphertext and then the private keys one by one to be semi-functional. We finally end up in a game where the challenge ciphertext and all private keys are semi-functional at which point proving security is straightforward.",

In this new world of computing, users are universally required to accept the underlying premise of trust. Within the cloud computing world, the virtual environment lets users access computing power that exceeds that contained within their own physical worlds. Typically, users will know neither the exact location of their data nor the other sources of the data collectively stored with theirs. The data you can find in a cloud ranges from public source, which has minimal security concerns, to private data containing highly sensitive information (such as social security numbers, medical records, or shipping manifests for hazardous material). Does using a cloud environment alleviate the business entities of their responsibility to ensure that proper security measures are in place for both their data and applications, or do they share joint responsibility with service providers? The answers to this and other questions lie within the realm of yet-to-be-written law. As with most technological advances, regulators are typically in a \"catch-up\" mode to identify policy, governance, and law.

A user can encrypt data in terms of any boolean formula over attributes issued from any chosen set of authorities. Finally, our system does not require any central authority. \n \nIn constructing our system, our largest technical hurdle is to make it collusion resistant. Prior Attribute-Based Encryption systems achieved collusion resistance when the ABE system authority \"tied\" together different components (representing different attributes) of a user's private key by randomizing the key. However, in our system each component will come from a potentially different authority, where we assume no coordination between such authorities. We create new techniques to tie key components together and prevent collusion attacks between users with different global identifiers. \n \nWe prove our system secure using the recent dual system encryption methodology where the security proof works by first converting the challenge ciphertext and private keys to a semi-functional form and then arguing security.

      "abstract": "Cloud computing denotes an architectural shift toward thin clients and conveniently centralized provision of computing resources. Clients' lack of direct resource control in the cloud prompts concern about the potential for data privacy violations, particularly abuse or leakage of sensitive information by service providers. Cryptography is an oft-touted remedy. Among its most powerful primitives is fully homomorphic encryption (FHE), dubbed by some the field's \"Holy Grail,\" and recently realized as a fully functional construct with seeming promise for cloud privacy. \n \nWe argue that cryptography alone can't enforce the privacy demanded by common cloud computing services, even with such powerful tools as FHE. We formally define a hierarchy of natural classes of private cloud applications, and show that no cryptographic protocol can implement those classes where data is shared among clients. We posit that users of cloud services will also need to rely on other forms of privacy enforcement, such as tamperproof hardware, distributed computing, and complex trust ecosystems.",

      "abstract": "Following Gennaro, Gentry, and Parno (Cryptology ePrint Archive 2009/547), we use fully homomorphic encryption to design improved schemes for delegating computation. In such schemes, a delegator outsources the computation of a function F on many, dynamically chosen inputs xi to a worker in such a way that it is infeasible for the worker to make the delegator accept a result other than F(xi). The \"online stage\" of the Gennaro et al. scheme is very efficient: the parties exchange two messages, the delegator runs in time poly(log T), and the worker runs in time poly(T), where T is the time complexity of F. However, the \"offline stage\" (which depends on the function F but not the inputs to be delegated) is inefficient: the delegator runs in time poly(T) and generates a public key of length poly(T) that needs to be accessed by the worker during the online stage. \n \nOur first construction eliminates the large public key from the Gennaro et al. scheme. The delegator still invests poly(T) time in the offline stage, but does not need to communicate or publish anything. Our second construction reduces the work of the delegator in the offline stage to poly(log T) at the price of a 4-message (offline) interaction with a poly(T)-time worker (which need not be the same as the workers used in the online stage). Finally, we describe a \"pipelined\" implementation of the second construction that avoids the need to re-run the offline construction after errors are detected (assuming errors are not too frequent).",

We explore how to extend this to multiple parties, using threshold fully homomorphic encryption (TFHE). In such scheme, the parties jointly generate a common FHE public key along with a secret key that is shared among them; they can later cooperatively decrypt ciphertexts without learning anything but the plaintext. We show how to instantiate this approach efficiently, by extending the recent FHE schemes of Brakerski, Gentry and Vaikuntanathan (CRYPTO '11, FOCS '11, ITCS '12) based on the (ring) learning with errors assumption. Our main tool is to exploit the property that such schemes are additively homomorphic over their keys. \n \nUsing TFHE, we construct simple multiparty computation protocols secure against fully malicious attackers, tolerating any number of corruptions, and providing security in the universal composability framework. Our protocols have the following properties: Low interaction: 3 rounds of interaction given a common random string, or 2 rounds with a public-key infrastructure. Low communication: independent of the function being computed (proportional to just input and output sizes). Cloud-assisted computation: the bulk of the computation can be efficiently outsourced to an external entity (e.g. a cloud service) so that the computation of all other parties is independent of the complexity of the evaluated function.",

In this paper we reduce the public key size to O(λ7) by encrypting with a quadratic form in the public key elements, instead of a linear form. We prove that the scheme remains semantically secure, based on a stronger variant of the approximate-GCD problem, already considered by van Dijk et al. \n \nWe alsodescribe the first implementation of the resulting fully homomorphic scheme. Borrowing some optimizations from the recent Gentry-Halevi implementation of Gentry's scheme, we obtain roughly the same level of efficiency.

A common mobile cloud secure data service is to inquiry the data from sensing devices. The data can be collected from multiple requesters, which may drain out the power of sensing devices quickly. Thus, an efficient data access control model is desired. To this end, we present a comprehensive security data inquiry framework for mobile cloud computing. Our solution focuses on the following two research directions: First, we present a novel Privacy Preserving Cipher Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (PP-CP-ABE) to protect sensing data. Using PP-CP-ABE, light-weight devices can securely outsource heavy encryption and decryption operations to cloud service providers, without revealing the data content. Second, we propose an Attribute Based Data Storage (ABDS) system as a cryptographic group-based access control mechanism. Our performance assessments demonstrate the security strength and efficiency of the presented solution in terms of computation, communication, and storage.",

      "abstract": "We present a somewhat homomorphic encryption scheme that is both very simple to describe and analyze, and whose security (quantumly) reduces to the worst-case hardness of problems on ideal lattices. We then transform it into a fully homomorphic encryption scheme using standard \"squashing\" and \"bootstrapping\" techniques introduced by Gentry (STOC 2009). \n \nOne of the obstacles in going from \"somewhat\" to full homomorphism is the requirement that the somewhat homomorphic scheme be circular secure, namely, the scheme can be used to securely encrypt its own secret key. For all known somewhat homomorphic encryption schemes, this requirement was not known to be achievable under any cryptographic assumption, and had to be explicitly assumed. We take a step forward towards removing this additional assumption by proving that our scheme is in fact secure when encrypting polynomial functions of the secret key. \n \nOur scheme is based on the ring learning with errors (RLWE) assumption that was recently introduced by Lyubashevsky, Peikert and Regev (Eurocrypt 2010). The RLWE assumption is reducible to worstcase problems on ideal lattices, and allows us to completely abstract out the lattice interpretation, resulting in an extremely simple scheme. For example, our secret key is s, and our public key is (a, b = as+2e), where s, a, e are all degree (n - 1) integer polynomials whose coefficients are independently drawn from easy to sample distributions.",

Our core tool is a new procedure called ciphertext delegation that allows a ciphertext to be 're-encrypted' to a more restrictive policy using only public information.Second, we study the problem of revocable attribute-based encryption. We provide the first fully secure construction by modifying an attribute-based encryption scheme due to Lewko et al. [9] and prove security in the standard model. \n \nWe then combine these two results for a new approach for revocation on stored data.

Using SIMD techniques, we can process over 54 blocks in each evaluation, yielding an amortized rate of just under 40 minutes per block.

In particular, they provide strong solutions to the problem of verifiably delegating computation. We construct the first fully-succinct publicly-verifiable SNARK. To do that, we first show how to \"bootstrap\" any SNARK that requires expensive preprocessing to obtain a SNARK that does not, while preserving public verifiability. We then apply this transformation to known SNARKs with preprocessing. Moreover, the SNARK we construct only requires of the prover time and space that are essentially the same as that required for classical NP verification. Our transformation assumes only collision-resistant hashing; curiously, it does not rely on PCPs. We also show an analogous transformation for privately-verifiable SNARKs, assuming fully-homomorphic encryption.\n At the heart of our transformations is a technique for recursive composition of SNARKs. This technique uses in an essential way the proof-carrying data (PCD) framework, which extends SNARKs to the setting of distributed networks of provers and verifiers. Concretely, to bootstrap a given SNARK, we recursively compose the SNARK to obtain a \"weak\" PCD system for shallow distributed computations, and then use the PCD framework to attain stronger notions of SNARKs and PCD systems.",

      "abstract": "Searchable symmetric encryption (SSE) enables a client to outsource a collection of encrypted documents in the cloud and retain the ability to perform keyword searches without revealing information about the contents of the documents and queries. Although efficient SSE constructions are known, previous solutions are highly sequential. This is mainly due to the fact that, currently, the only method for achieving sub-linear time search is the inverted index approach (Curtmola, Garay, Kamara and Ostrovsky, CCS ’06) which requires the search algorithm to access a sequence of memory locations, each of which is unpredictable and stored at the previous location in the sequence. Motivated by advances in multi-core architectures, we present a new method for constructing sub-linear SSE schemes. Our approach is highly parallelizable and dynamic. With roughly a logarithmic number of cores in place, searches for a keyword w in our scheme execute in o(r) parallel time, where r is the number of documents containing keyword w (with more cores, this bound can go down to O(logn), i.e., independent of the result size r). Such time complexity outperforms the optimal Θ(r) sequential search time—a similar bound holds for the updates. Our scheme also achieves the following important properties: (a) it enjoys a strong notion of security, namely security against adaptive chosen-keyword attacks; (b) compared to existing sub-linear dynamic SSE schemes (e.g., Kamara, Papamanthou, Roeder, CCS ’12), updates in our scheme do not leak any information, apart from information that can be inferred from previous search tokens; (c) it can be implemented efficiently in external memory (with logarithmic I/O overhead). Our technique is simple and uses a red-black tree data structure; its security is proven in the random oracle model.",

      "abstract": "Large scale data processing brings new challenges to the design of privacy-preserving protocols: how to meet the increasing requirements of speed and throughput of modern applications, and how to scale up smoothly when data being protected is big. Efficiency and scalability become critical criteria for privacy preserving protocols in the age of Big Data. In this paper, we present a new Private Set Intersection (PSI) protocol that is extremely efficient and highly scalable compared with existing protocols. The protocol is based on a novel approach that we call oblivious Bloom intersection. It has linear complexity and relies mostly on efficient symmetric key operations. It has high scalability due to the fact that most operations can be parallelized easily. The protocol has two versions: a basic protocol and an enhanced protocol, the security of the two variants is analyzed and proved in the semi-honest model and the malicious model respectively. A prototype of the basic protocol has been built. We report the result of performance evaluation and compare it against the two previously fastest PSI protocols. Our protocol is orders of magnitude faster than these two protocols. To compute the intersection of two million-element sets, our protocol needs only 41 seconds (80-bit security) and 339 seconds (256-bit security) on moderate hardware in parallel mode.",

The first plausible construction of such multilinear maps has recently been described by Garg, Gentry and Halevi, based on ideal lattices. In this paper we describe a different construction that works over the integers instead of ideal lattices, similar to the DGHV fully homomorphic encryption scheme. We also describe a different technique for proving the full randomization of encodings: instead of Gaussian linear sums, we apply the classical leftover hash lemma over a quotient lattice. We show that our construction is relatively practical: for reasonable security parameters a one-round 7-party Diffie-Hellman key exchange requires less than 40 seconds per party. Moreover, in contrast with previous work, multilinear analogues of useful, base group assumptions like DLIN appear to hold in our setting.",

However, in 2011, Stehle and Steinfeld showed how to modify NTRUEncrypt to reduce security to standard problems in ideal lattices. In 2012, Lopez-Alt, Tromer and Vaikuntanathan proposed a fully homomorphic scheme based on this modified system. However, to allow homomorphic operations and prove security, a non-standard assumption is required. In this paper, we show how to remove this non-standard assumption via techniques introduced by Brakerski and construct a new fully homomorphic encryption scheme from the Stehle and Steinfeld version based on standard lattice assumptions and a circular security assumption. The scheme is scale-invariant and therefore avoids modulus switching and the size of ciphertexts is one ring element. Moreover, we present a practical variant of our scheme, which is secure under stronger assumptions, along with parameter recommendations and promising implementation results. Finally, we present an approach for encrypting larger input sizes by extending ciphertexts to several ring elements via the CRT on the message space.",

A foundation for secure computation is oblivious transfer (OT), which traditionally requires expensive public key cryptography. A more efficient way to perform many OTs is to extend a small number of base OTs using OT extensions based on symmetric cryptography.\n In this work we present optimizations and efficient implementations of OT and OT extensions in the semi-honest model. We propose a novel OT protocol with security in the standard model and improve OT extensions with respect to communication complexity, computation complexity, and scalability. We also provide specific optimizations of OT extensions that are tailored to the secure computation protocols of Yao and Goldreich-Micali-Wigderson and reduce the communication complexity even further. We experimentally verify the efficiency gains of our protocols and optimizations. By applying our implementation to current secure computation frameworks, we can securely compute a Levenshtein distance circuit with 1.29 billion AND gates at a rate of 1.2 million AND gates per second. Moreover, we demonstrate the importance of correctly implementing OT within secure computation protocols by presenting an attack on the FastGC framework.",

      "abstract": "Garbled circuits, introduced by Yao in the mid 80s, allow computing a function f on an input x without leaking anything about f or x besides f(x). Garbled circuits found numerous applications, but every known construction suffers from one limitation: it offers no security if used on multiple inputs x. In this paper, we construct for the first time  reusable garbled circuits. The key building block is a new succinct single-key functional encryption scheme.\n Functional encryption is an ambitious primitive: given an encryption Enc(x) of a value x, and a secret key sk_f for a function f, anyone can compute f(x) without learning any other information about x. We construct, for the first time, a succinct functional encryption scheme for {\\em any} polynomial-time function f where succinctness means that the ciphertext size does not grow with the size of the circuit for f, but only with its depth. The security of our construction is based on the intractability of the Learning with Errors (LWE) problem and holds as long as an adversary has access to a single key sk_f (or even an a priori bounded number of keys for different functions).\n Building on our succinct single-key functional encryption scheme, we show several new applications in addition to reusable garbled circuits, such as a paradigm for general function obfuscation which we call token-based obfuscation, homomorphic encryption for a class of Turing machines where the evaluation runs in input-specific time rather than worst-case time, and a scheme for delegating computation which is publicly verifiable and maintains the privacy of the computation.",

      "abstract": "The surprising success of cryptocurrencies has led to a surge of interest in deploying large scale, highly robust, Byzantine fault tolerant (BFT) protocols for mission-critical applications, such as financial transactions. Although the conventional wisdom is to build atop a (weakly) synchronous protocol such as PBFT (or a variation thereof), such protocols rely critically on network timing assumptions, and only guarantee liveness when the network behaves as expected. We argue these protocols are ill-suited for this deployment scenario. We present an alternative, HoneyBadgerBFT, the first practical asynchronous BFT protocol, which guarantees liveness without making any timing assumptions. We base our solution on a novel atomic broadcast protocol that achieves optimal asymptotic efficiency. We present an implementation and experimental results to show our system can achieve throughput of tens of thousands of transactions per second, and scales to over a hundred nodes on a wide area network. We even conduct BFT experiments over Tor, without needing to tune any parameters. Unlike the alternatives, HoneyBadgerBFT simply does not care about the underlying network.",

      "abstract": "Algorand is a new cryptocurrency that confirms transactions with latency on the order of a minute while scaling to many users. Algorand ensures that users never have divergent views of confirmed transactions, even if some of the users are malicious and the network is temporarily partitioned. In contrast, existing cryptocurrencies allow for temporary forks and therefore require a long time, on the order of an hour, to confirm transactions with high confidence.\n Algorand uses a new Byzantine Agreement (BA) protocol to reach consensus among users on the next set of transactions. To scale the consensus to many users, Algorand uses a novel mechanism based on Verifiable Random Functions that allows users to privately check whether they are selected to participate in the BA to agree on the next set of transactions, and to include a proof of their selection in their network messages. In Algorand's BA protocol, users do not keep any private state except for their private keys, which allows Algorand to replace participants immediately after they send a message. This mitigates targeted attacks on chosen participants after their identity is revealed.\n We implement Algorand and evaluate its performance on 1,000 EC2 virtual machines, simulating up to 500,000 users. Experimental results show that Algorand confirms transactions in under a minute, achieves 125x Bitcoin's throughput, and incurs almost no penalty for scaling to more users.",

      "abstract": "We design a novel, communication-efficient, failure-robust protocol for secure aggregation of high-dimensional data. Our protocol allows a server to compute the sum of large, user-held data vectors from mobile devices in a secure manner (i.e. without learning each user's individual contribution), and can be used, for example, in a federated learning setting, to aggregate user-provided model updates for a deep neural network. We prove the security of our protocol in the honest-but-curious and active adversary settings, and show that security is maintained even if an arbitrarily chosen subset of users drop out at any time. We evaluate the efficiency of our protocol and show, by complexity analysis and a concrete implementation, that its runtime and communication overhead remain low even on large data sets and client pools. For 16-bit input values, our protocol offers $1.73 x communication expansion for 210 users and 220-dimensional vectors, and 1.98 x expansion for 214 users and 224-dimensional vectors over sending data in the clear.",
