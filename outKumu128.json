While typesetting, I tried to stick to the original manuscript as much as possible. However, there were some cases, such as a few typos or punctuation marks, which were changed. As in many papers on cryptography, Alice and Bob play the role of participants of the given cryptographic protocols. For the sake of readability, Alice’s and Bob’s messages were printed in red and blue ink, respectively. This work was carefully proofread by my colleague Y. Sobhdel (sobhdel@ce.sharif.edu). Thanks also to H. M. Moghaddam for mentioning a minor mistake in an earlier version. That said, I will be thankful if you inform me of any possible mistakes.",

Such path problems include finding shortest paths, solving sparse systems of linear equations, and carrying out global flow analysis of computer programs. Our method consists of two steps. First, we construct a collection of regular expressions representing sets of paths in the graph. This can be done by using any standard algorithm, such as Gaussian or Gauss-Jordan elimination. Next, we apply a natural mapping from regular expressions into the given problem domain. We exhibit the mappings required to find shortest paths, solve sparse systems of linear equations, and carry out global flow analysis. Our results provide a general-purpose algorithm for solving any path problem, and show that the problem of constructing path expressions is in some sense the most general path problem.",

Among well-known problems to fall into this category we find range query, point enclosure, intersection, near-neighbor problems, etc. The approach which we take is very general and rests on a new concept called fitering search. We show on a number of examples how it can be used to improve the complexity of known algorithms and simplify their implementations as well. In particular, filtering search allows us to improve on the worst-case complexity of the best algorithms known so far for solving the problems mentioned above.",

If the network is large it becomes impractical or even impossible to store all keys securely at the users. A natural solution then is to supply each user with a relatively small amount of secret data from which he can derive all his keys. A scheme for this purpose will be presented and we call such a scheme a symmetric key generation system (SKGS). However, as all keys will be generated from a small amount of data, dependencies between keys will exist. Therefore by cooperation, users in the system might be able to decrease their uncertainty about keys they should not have access to.The objective of this paper is to present a class of SKGS for which the amount of secret information needed by each user to generate his keys is the least possible while at the same time a certain minimum number of users have to cooperate to resolve the uncertainty of unknown keys.",

Only a group with a majority of votes can execute the critical operations, and mutual exclusion is achieved because at any given time there is at most one such group. A second strategy, which appears to be similar to votes, is to define a priori a set of groups that intersect each other. Any group of nodes that finds itself in this set can perform the restricted operations. In this paper, both of these strategies are studied in detail and it is shown that they are not equivalent in general (although they are in some cases). In doing so, a number of other interesting properties are proved. These properties will be of use to a system designer who is selecting a vote assignment or a set of groups for a specific application.",

It is applied to solve a general class of problems which include most of the two-party cryptographic problems in the literature. Specifically, we show how two parties A and B can interactively generate a random integer N = p?q such that its secret, i.e., the prime factors (p, q), is hidden from either party individually but is recoverable jointly if desired. This can be utilized to give a protocol for two parties with private values i and j to compute any polynomially computable functions f(i,j) and g(i,j) with minimal knowledge transfer and a strong fairness property. As a special case, A and B can exchange a pair of secrets sA, sB, e.g. the factorization of an integer and a Hamiltonian circuit in a graph, in such a way that sA becomes computable by B when and only when sB becomes computable by A. All these results are proved assuming only that the problem of factoring large intergers is computationally intractable.",

      "abstract": "A protocol is presented that allows a set of parties to collectively perform any agreed computation, where every party is able to choose secret inputs and verify that the resulting output is correct, and where all secret inputs are optimally protected. The protocol has the following properties: ? One participant is allowed to hide his secrets unconditionally, i.e. the protocol releases no Shannon information about these secrets. This means that a participant with bounded resources can perform computations securely with a participant who may have unlimited computing power. To the best of our knowledge, our protocol is the first of its kind to provide this possibility. ? The cost of our protocol is linear in the number of gates in a circuit performing the computation, and in the number of participants. We believe it is conceptually simpler and more efficient than other protocols solving related problems ([Y1], [GoMiWi] and [GaHaYu]). It therefore leads to practical solutions of problems involving small circuits. ? The protocol is openly verifiable, i.e. any number of people can later come in and rechallenge any participant to verify that no cheating has occurred. ? The protocol is optimally secure against conspiracies: even if n - 1 out of the n participants collude, they will not find out more about the remaining participants' secrets than what they could already infer from their own input and the public output. ? Each participant has a chance of undetected cheating that is only exponentially small in the amount of time and space needed for the protocol. ? The protocol adapts easily, and with negligible extra cost, to various additional requirements, e.g. making part of the output private to some participant, ensuring that the participants learn the output simultaneously, etc. ? Participants can prove relations between data used in different instances of the protocol, even if those instances involve different groups of participants. For example, it can be proved that the output of one computation was used as input to another, without revealing more about this data. ? The protocol can be usen as an essential tool in proving that all languages in IP have zero knowledge proof systems, i.e. any statement which can be proved interactively can also be proved in zero knowledge.The rest of this paper is organised as follows: First we survey some related results. Then Section 2 gives an intuitive introduction to the protocol. In Section 3, we present one of the main tools used in this paper: bit commitment schemes. Sections 4 and 5 contain the notation, terrninology, etc. used in the paper. In Section 6, the protocol is presented, along with proofs of its security and correctness. In Section 7, we show how to adapt the protocol to various extra requirements and discuss some generalisations and optimisations. Finally, Section 8 contains some remarks on how to construct zero knowledge proof systems for any language in IP.",

      "abstract": "At EUROCRYPT'88, we introduced an interactive zero-knowledge protocol (Guillou and Quisquater [13]) fitted to the authentication of tamper-resistant devices (e.g. smart cards, Guillou and Ugon [14]).Each security device stores its secret authentication number, an RSA-like signature computed by an authority from the device identity. Any transaction between a tamper-resistant security device and a verifier is limited to a unique interaction: the device sends its identity and a random test number, then the verifier tells a random large question; and finally the device answers by a witness number. The transaction is successful when the test number is reconstructed from the witness number, the question and the identity according to numbers published by the authority and rules of redundancy possibly standardized.This protocol allows a cooperation between users in such a way that a group of cooperative users looks like a new entity, having a shadowed identity the product of the individual shadowed identities, while each member reveals nothing about its secret.In another scenario, the secret is partitioned between distinct devices sharing the same identity. A group of cooperative users looks like a unique user having a larger public exponent which is the greater common multiple of each individual exponent.In this paper, additional features are introduced in order to provide: firstly, a mutual interactive authentication of both communicating entities and previously exchanged messages, and, secondly, a digital signature of messages, with a non-interactive zero-knowledge protocol. The problem of multiple signature is solved here in a very smart way due to the possibilities of cooperation between users.The only secret key is the factors of the composite number chosen by the authority delivering one authentication number to each smart card. This key is not known by the user. At the user level, such a scheme may be considered as a keyless identity-based integrity scheme. This integrity has anew and important property: it cannot be misused, i.e. derived into a confidentiality scheme.",

      "abstract": "The authors describe a secure teleconferencing system which can be operated in the public communications network. In this system, advantage is taken of the fact that clear speech must be available at each telephone set for the local participant, and this can be used with a distributed conference circuit to provide a multiparty conferencing system. The network conference control unit knows the addresses of all the participants but its role is limited to provided channel connections and demultiplexing and distributing unaltered signals from the participants. The conference unit does not need to know any security information. The system can operate with a number of security methods, and the users are free to select the techniques that they are most comfortable with. The system is suitable for implementation in digital networks such as the integrated service digital network, and can provide extremely high quality and robust operation. >",

Threshold schemes, however, can only handle a small fraction of the secret sharing functions which we may wish to form. For example, if it is desirable to divide a secret among four participants A, B, C, and D in such a way that either A together with B can reconstruct the secret or C together with D can reconstruct the secret, then threshold schemes (even with weighting) are provably insufficient.This paper will present general methods for constructing secret sharing schemes for any given secret sharing function. There is a natural correspondence between the set of \"generalized\" secret sharing functions and the set of monotone functions, and tools developed for simplifying the latter set can be applied equally well to the former set.",

But all the while, it had resisted a full and satisfactory formulation.Our definition is built on several new ideas. Among them: ? Closely mimicking an ideal evaluation. A secure protocol must mimic this abstraction in a run-by-run manner, our definition depending as much on individual executions as on global properties of ensembles. ? Blending privacy and correctness in a novel way, using a special type of simulator designed for the purpose. ? Requiring adversarial awareness--capturing the idea that the adversary should know, in a very strong sense, certain information associated to the execution of a protocol.Among the noteworthy and desirable properties of our definition is the reducibility of secure protocols, which we believe to be a cornerstone in a mature theory of secure computation.",

      "abstract": "The difference between theory and practice often rests on one major factor: efficiency. In distributed systems, communication is usually expensive, and protocols designed for practical use must require as few rounds of communication and as small messages as possible.A secure multiparty protocol to compute function F is a protocol that, when each player i of n players starts with private input xi, provides each participant i with F(x1,...xn) without revealing more information than what can be derived from learning the function value. Some number l of players may be corrupted by an adversary who may then change the messages they send. Recent solutions to this problem have suffered in practical terms: while theoretically using only polynomially-many rounds, in practice the constants and exponents of such polynomials are too great. Normally, such protocols express F as a circuit CF, call on each player to secretly share xi, and proceed to perform \"secret addition and multiplication\" on secretly shared values. The cost is proportional to the depth of CF times the cost of secret multiplication; and multiplication requires several rounds of interaction.We present a protocol that simplifies the body of such a protocol and significantly reduces the number of rounds of interaction. The steps of our protocol take advantage of a new and counterintuitive technique for evaluating a circuit: set every input to every gate in the circuit completely at random, and then make corrections. Our protocol replaces each secret multiplication -- multiplication that requires further sharing, addition, zero-knowledge proofs, and secret reconstruction -- that is used during the body of a standard protocol by a simple reconstruction of secretly shared values, thereby reducing rounds by an order of magnitude. Furthermore, these reconstructions require only broadcast messages (but do not require Byzantine Agreement). The simplicity of broadcast and reconstruction provides efficiency and ease of implementation. Our transformation is simple and compatible with other techniques for reducing rounds.",

Loosely speaking, it is possible to demonstrate that a CNF formula is satisfiable without revealing any other property of the formula, in particular, without yielding neither a satis@ing assignment nor properties such as whether there is a satisfying assignment in which xl = X3 etc. It is also demonstrated that zero-knowledge proofs exist \"outside the domain of cryptography and number theory. \" Using no assumptions. it is shown that both graph isomorphism and graph nonisomor- phism have zero-knowledge interactive proofs. The mere existence of an interactive proof for graph nonisomorphism is interesting, since graph nonisomorphism is not known to be in NP and hence no efficient proofs were known before for demonstrating that two graphs are not isomorphic.",

      "abstract": "The problem of secure multiparty computation is usually described as follows: each of n players in a network holds a private input xi. Together they would like to compute a function F(x1,...,xn) without revealing the inputs, even though no particular player can be trusted. Attempts to contrive formal definitions for the problem have treated properties of the solution separately (correctness, privacy, etc.), giving an ad hoc collection of desirable properties and varied definitions that do not support clear or comparable proofs.We propose a clear, concise, and unified definition for security and reliability in interactive computations. We develop a reduction called relative resilience that captures all desired properties at a single blow. Relative resilience allows one to classify and compare arbitrary protocols in terms of security and reliability, in the same way that Turing reductions allow one to classify and compare algorithms in terms of complexity. Security and reliability reduce to a simple statement: a protocol for F is resilient if it is as resilient as an ideal protocol in which a trusted host is available to compute F. Relative resilience captures the notions of security and reliability for a wide variety of interactive computations, including zero-knowledge proof systems, Byzantine Agreement, oblivious transfer, two-party oblivious circuit evaluation, among others.Relative resilience provides modular proof techniques that other approaches lack: one may compare a sequence of protocols ranging from the real-world protocol to the ideal protocol, proving the relative resilience of each successive protocol with greater clarity and less complexity. Folk theorems about the \"transitivity\" of security and the security of concatenated protocols are now provable; and the proofs reveal that such folk theorems fail under subtle conditions that have previously gone unnoticed. The conciseness and modularity of our definitions and proof techniques provide great clarity in designing and reasoning about protocols and have already lead to provably secure protocols that are significantly more efficient than those appearing in the literature.",

The set of all qualified subsets defines the access structure to the secret. Sharing schemes are useful in the management of cryptographic keys and in multy-party secure protocols.We analyze the relationships among the entropies of the sample spaces from which the shares and the secret are chosen. We show that there are access structures with 4 participants for which any secret sharing scheme must give to a participant a share at least 50% greater than the secret size. This is the first proof that there exist access structures for which the best achievable information rate (i.e., the ratio between the size of the secret and that of the largest share) is bounded away from 1. The bound is the best possible, as we construct a secret sharing scheme for the above access structures which meets the bound with equality.",

There exist many heuristics and ad-hoc methods for protection, but the problem as a whole has not received the theoretical treatment it deserves. In this paper, we provide theoretical treatment of software protection. We reduce the problem of software protection to the problem of efficient simulation on oblivious RAM.\nA machine is oblivious if thhe sequence in which it accesses memory locations is equivalent for any two inputs with the same running time. For example, an oblivious Turing Machine is one for which the movement of the heads on the tapes is identical for each computation. (Thus, the movement is independent of the actual input.) What is the slowdown in the running time of a machine, if it is required to be oblivious? In 1979, Pippenger and Fischer showed how a two-tape oblivious Turing Machine can simulate, on-line, a one-tape Turing Machine, with a logarithmic slowdown in the running time. We show an analogous result for the random-access machine (RAM) model of computation. In particular, we show how to do an on-line simulation of an arbitrary RAM by a probabilistic oblivious RAM with a polylogaithmic slowdown in the running time. On the other hand, we show that a logarithmic slowdown is a lower bound.",

For instance, when a person conducts a cryptographic identification protocol at an entrance to a building, the access control computer in the building would like to be ensured that the person giving the responses is no more than a few meters away.

It can be integrated into common identification protocols.

However, the proof of this lower bound uses the notion of information theoretic secrecy. A natural (and very practical) question is whether one can do better for secret sharing if the notion of secrecy is computational, namely, against resource bounded adversaries. In this note we observe that, indeed, one can do much better in the computational model (which is the one used in most applications).We present an m-threshold scheme, where m shares recover the secret but m - 1 shares give no (computational) information on the secret, in which shares corresponding to a secret S are of size |S|/m plus a short piece of information whose length does not depend on the secret size but just in the security parameter. (The bound of |S|/m is clearly optimal if the secret is to be recovered from m shares). Therefore, for moderately large secrets (a confidential file, a long message, a large data base) the savings in space and communication over traditional schemes is remarkable.The scheme is very simple and combines in a natural way traditional (perfect) secret sharing schemes, encryption, and information dispersal. It is provable secure given a secure (e.g., private key) encryption function.",

We explain why auxiliary-input zero-knowledge is a definition more suitable for cryptographic applications than the original [GMR1] definition. In particular, we show that any protocol solely composed of subprotocols which are auxiliary-input zero-knowledge is itself auxiliary-input zero-knowledge. We show that blackbox-simulation zero-knowledge implies auxiliary-input zero-knowledge (which in turn implies the [GMR1] definition). We argue that all known zero-knowledge proofs are in fact blackbox-simulation zero-knowledge (i.e., we proved zero-knowledge using blackbox-simulation of the verifier). As a result, all known zero-knowledge proof systems are shown to be auxiliary-input zero-knowledge and can be used for cryptographic applications such as those in [GMW2].We demonstrate the triviality of certain classes of zero-knowledge proof systems, in the sense that only languages in BPP have zero-knowledge proofs of these classes. In particular, we show that any language having a Las Vegas zero-knowledge proof system necessarily belongs to RP. We show that randomness of both the verifier and the prover, and nontriviality of the interaction are essential properties of (nontrivial) auxiliary-input zero-knowledge proofs.",

Firm believers in Schrodinger and Heisenberg, they might accept a quantum OT device, but IBM's prototype is not yet portable. Instead, as part of their prenuptial agreement, they decide to visit IBM and perform some OT's in advance, so that any later divorces, coin-flipping or other important interactions can be done more conveniently, without needing expensive third parties.Unfortunately, OT can't be done in advance in a direct way, because even though Bob might not know what bit Alice will later send (even if she first sends a random bit and later corrects it, for example), he would already know which bit or bits he will receive. We address the problem of precomputing oblivious transfer and show that OT can be precomputed at a cost of ?(k) prior transfers (a tight bound). In contrast, we show that variants of OT, such as one-out-of-two OT, can be precomputed using only one prior transfer. Finally, we show that all variants can be reduced to a single precomputed one-out-of-two oblivious transfer.",

      "abstract": "Emulators that translate algorithms from the shared-memory model to two different message-passing models are presented. Both are achieved by implementing a wait-free, atomic, single-writer multi-reader register in unreliable, asynchronous networks. The two message-passing models considered are a complete network with processor failures and an arbitrary network with dynamic link failures.\nThese results make it possible to view the shared-memory model as a higher-level language for designing algorithms in asynchronous distributed systems. Any wait-free algorithm based on atomic, single-writer multi-reader registers can be automatically emulated in message-passing systems, provided that at least a majority of the processors are not faulty and remain connected. The overhead introduced by these emulations is polynomial in the number of processors in the system.\nImmediate new results are obtained by applying the emulators to known shared-memory algorithms. These include, among others, protocols to solve the following problems in the message-passing model in the presence of processor or link failures: multi-writer multi-reader registers, concurrent time-stamp systems, l-exclusion, atomic snapshots, randomized consensus, and implementation of data structures.",

This in particular includes the cases of players that refuse to participate or that generate incorrect partial signatures. Our robust protocols achieve optimal resiliency as they can tolerate up to (N - 1)/2 faults, and their efficiency is comparable to the efficiency of the underlying threshold RSA signature scheme. \n \nRobust threshold signature schemes have very important applications, since they provide increased security and availability for a signing server (e.g. a certification authority or an electronic cash provider). Solutions for the case of the RSA signature scheme are especially important because of its widespread use.

      "abstract": "6 Coercing the Sender vs. Coercing the Receiver We describe simple constructions that transform sender-deniable schemes into receiver-deniable schemes and vice-versa. If there are other parties that can help in transmitting the data, we also construct a sender-and-receiver-deniable scheme from any sender-deniable scheme. We describe the constructions with respect to schemes that encrypt only one bit at a time. Generalizing these constructions to schemes that encrypt arbitrarily long messages is straightforward. These constructions apply to both shared-key and public-key settings. Receiver-deniability from Sender-deniability. Assume a sender-deniable encryption scheme A, and construct the following scheme B. Let b denote the bit to be transmitted from S to R. First R chooses a random bit r, and invokes the scheme A to send r to S. (That is, with respect to scheme A, R is the sender and S is the receiver.) Next, S sends b r to R, in the clear. If scheme A is sender-deniable then, when attacked, R can convincingly claim that the value of r was either 0 or 1, as desired. Consequently R can claim that the bit b was either 0 or 1, at wish, and scheme B is receiver-deniable. Sender-deniability from Receiver-deniability. We use the exact same construction. It is easy to verify that if A is receiver-deniable then B is sender-deniable. Sender-and-receiver-deniability. Assume that S and R can use other parties I1; :::; In as intermediaries in their communication. The following scheme is resilient against attacking the sender, the receiver and some intermediaries, as long as at least one intermediary remains unattacked. In order to transmit a bit b to R, S rst chooses n bits b1:::bn such that ibi = b. Next, S transmits bi to each intermediary Ii, using a sender-deniable scheme. Next, each Ii transmits bi to R using a receiverdeniable scheme. Finally R computes ibi = b. When an intermediary Ii is attacked, it reveals the true value of bi. However, as long as one intermediary Ij remains unattacked, both S and R can convincingly claim, when attacked, that the value of bj (and consequently the value of b) is either 0 or 1. Note that this scheme works only if the parties can `coordinate their stories', in the sense of Remark 2 to De nition 10. In particular, the sender and receiver must know, when attacked, which intermediaries are being attacked.4 References [1] M. Ajtai, Generating Hard Instances of Lattice Problems, STOC'96 [2] M.

A An Alternative Non-Committing Encryption Scheme Recently, general multiparty protocols secure against an adaptive adversary that corrupts parties based on past information were constructed [7]. At the heart of this construction is another type of encryption protocol, called non-committing encryptions. As in the case of deniable encryption, non-committing encryption is concerned with foiling an adversary that registers the ciphertext and later asks the sender and receiver to reveal their secret keys and random choices. Non-committing encryption o ers a considerably weaker solution to this problem than deniable encryption, (although non-committing encryption su ce for proving adaptive security.) Very roughly, a non-committing encryption scheme consists of the usual key-generation, encryption, and decryption algorithms that ensure correctness and semantic security, with the following extra property: There exists a simulator that simulates the process of encryption and decryption in a deniable. That is, the simulator rst generates dummy ciphertexts that are indistinguishable, in the eyes of the adversary, from authentic 12 ciphertexts. Next, when the adversary asks to see the internal data of the sender and the receiver, the simulator is able to choose an arbitrary cleartext and then present the adversary with data that is consistent the chosen cleartext. Note that in a non-committing scheme only the simulator can generate `dummy ciphertexts' that can be `opened' as encryptions of more than one value. The sender and receiver are unable to do so. Furthermore, the dummy ciphertexts of a non-committing scheme need not have meaningful decryption, whereas in deniable encryption each ciphertext has unique, meaningful decryption and at the same time can be opened in several ways for an adversary. In particular the non-committing scheme described in [7] is not deniable. Any public-key (n)-sender-and-receiver-deniable encryption scheme according to De nition 10 is noncommitting if (n) is negligible. However, we do not know if such a deniable scheme exists. (In this paper we only describe 1 nc -sender-and-receiver-deniable schemes, we're c is a constant.) It turns out, however, that the basic scheme described in Section 3, after being transformed into a sender-and-receiver-deniable scheme using the technique of Section 6, is a valid non-committing encryption scheme. In particular, this scheme is much simpler to present and prove than the [7] scheme. Call this scheme the transformed basic scheme. To show that the transformed basic scheme is non-committing, we have to describe the simulator. We use the fact that, in the basic scheme, cheating is undetectable in one direction (except for negligible probability). That is, the sender can encrypt 1 and later claim that the encrypted bit was 0. The dummy ciphertexts generated by the simulator will all be legal encryptions of 1. When, in a simulated execution, the sender and receiver are asked to demonstrate their internal data they can show that the encrypted bit was either 0 or 1, as desired. B De nitions 9 and 10 De nition 9 A protocol with sender S and receiver R, and with security parameter n is a (n)-receiverdeniable encryption protocol if it satis es De nition 2, with the exception that the Deniability property is replaced as follows. Deniability: There exists an e cient faking algorithm having the following property with respect to any m1; m2 2 M . Let rS ; rR be uniformly chosen random inputs of S and R, respectively, let c = com (m1; rS; rR), and let ~ rR = (m1; rR; c;m2). Then, the random variables (m2; ~ rR; c) and (m2; rR;com (m2; rS; rR)) are (n)-close. De nition 10 A protocol with sender S and receiver R, and with security parameter n is a (n)-senderand-receiver-deniable encryption protocol if it satis es De nition 2, with the exception that the Deniability property is replaced as follows. Deniability: There exist two e cient faking algorithms S and R having the following property with respect to any m1; m2 2 M . Let rS ; rR be uniformly chosen random inputs of S and R, respectively, let c = com (m1; rS; rR), let ~ rS = S(m1; rS; c;m2), and let ~ rR = R(m1; rR; c;m2). Then, the random variables (m2; ~ rS; ~ rR; c) and (m2; rS; rR;com (m2; rS; rR)) are (n)-close. 13 Remarks: 1. Note that the requirement from a sender-and-receiver-deniable encryption protocol is stronger than requiring that the protocol be both sender-deniable and receiver-deniable. 2. De nition 10 does not address the following issue. In order for the sender and the receiver to convince an adversary that attacks both, the parties need to have `consistent stories'. That is, they both should claim the same (fake or true) value for the cleartext. We believe that this `coordination' issue should be treated separately. (Indeed, it is extensively treated in [5].) Note that this issue does not appear when only the sender or only the receiver are attacked. 14",

Signing takes one RSA decryption plus some hashing, verification takes one RSA encryption plus some hashing, and the size of the signature is the size of the modulus. Assuming the underlying hash functions are ideal, our schemes are not only provably secure, but are so in a tight way-- an ability to forge signatures with a certain amount of computational resources implies the ability to invert RSA (on the same size modulus) with about the same computational effort. Furthermore, we provide a second scheme which maintains all of the above features and in addition provides message recovery. These ideas extend to provide schemes for Rabin signatures with analogous properties; in particular their security can be tightly related to the hardness of factoring.",

      "abstract": "A blind signature provides perfect confidentiality to a message and signature pair. Due to this feature, the blind signature has one downside; the signer can not assure himself that the blinded message accurately contains the information he desires. In a practical sense, it is essential for the signer to include some term of validity in the signing message to prevent abusing. Of course the term must not violate the confidentiality of the message. This paper discusses partial blinding of a signed message. We consider RSA and it is proved that forging the proposed scheme by multiple signing is as difficult as breaking RSA. The strategy can be also applied to those blind signature schemes that use a trapdoor function. An electronic cash system is shown as an application of the proposed scheme. Unlike most privacy-protected electronic cash system, it successfully minimizes the growth of the bank's database.",

      "abstract": "Secure and authenticated message delivery/storage is one of the major aims of computer and communication security research. The current standard method to achieve this aim is “(digital) signature followed by encryption”. In this paper, we address a question on the cost of secure and authenticated message delivery/storage, namely, whether it is possible to transport/store messages of varying length in a secure and authenticated way with an expense less than that required by “signature followed by encryption”. This question seems to have never been addressed in the literature since the invention of public key cryptography. We then present a positive answer to the question. In particular, we discover a new cryptographic primitive termed as “signcryption” which simultaneously fulfills both the functions of digital signature and public key encryption in a logically single step, and with a cost significantly lower than that required by “signature followed by encryption”. For typical security parameters for high level security applications (size of public moduli = 1536 bits), signcryption costs 50% (31%, respectively) less in computation time and 85% (91%, respectively) less in message expansion than does “signature followed by encryption” based on the discrete logarithm problem (factorization problem, respectively).",

      "abstract": "We present a new efficient paradigm for signing digital streams. The problem of signing digital streams to prove their authenticity is substantially different from the problem of signing regular messages. Traditional signature schemes are message oriented and require the receiver to process the entire message before being able to authenticate its signature. However, a stream is a potentially very long (or infinite) sequence of bits that the sender sends to the receiver and the receiver is required to consumes the received bits at more or less the input rate and without excessive delay. Therefore it is infeasible for the receiver to obtain the entire stream before authenticating and consuming it. Examples of streams include digitized video and audio files, data feeds and applets. We present two solutions to the problem of authenticating digital streams. The first one is for the case of a finite stream which is entirely known to the sender (say a movie). We use this constraint to devise an extremely efficient solution. The second case is for a (potentially infinite) stream which is not known in advance to the sender (for example a live broadcast). We present proofs of security of our constructions. Our techniques also have applications in other areas, for example, efficient authentication of long files when communication is at a cost and signature based filtering at a proxy server.",

This means that the queries give each individual database no partial information (in the information theoretic or computational sense) on the identity of the item retrieved by the user. All known PIR schemes assume that the user knows the physical address of the sought item. This is usually not the case when accessing a public database that is not managed by the user. Such databases are typically presented with keywords, which are then internally translated (at the database end) to physical addresses, using an appropriate search structure (for example, a hash table or a binary tree). In this note we describe a simple, modular way to privately access data by keywords. It combines any conventional search structure with any underlying PIR scheme (including single server schemes). The transformation requires no modiication in the way that the search structure is maintained. Therefore the same database will support both private and regular (non private) searches.",

The main cost measure for such a scheme is its communication complexity. In this paper we introduce a model of symmetrically-private information retrieval (SPIR), where the privacy of the data, as well as the privacy of the user, is guaranteed. That is, in every invocation of a SPIR protocol, the user learns only a single physical bit of x and no other information about the data. Previously known PIR schemes severely fail to meet this goal. We show how to transform PIR schemes into SPIR schemes (with information-theoretic privacy), paying a constant factor in communication complexity. To this end, we introduce and utilize a new cryptographic primitive, called conditional disclosure of secrets, which we believe may be a useful building block for the design of other cryptographic protocols. In particular, we get a k-database SPIR scheme of complexity O(n1/(2k?1)) for every constant k?2 and an O(logn)-database SPIR scheme of complexity O(log2n·loglogn). All our schemes require only a single round of interaction, and are resilient to any dishonest behavior of the user. These results also yield the first implementation of a distributed version of (n1)-OT (1-out-of-n oblivious transfer) with information-theoretic security and sublinear communication complexity.",

      "abstract": "Recently, there has been an interest in making electronic cash protocols more practical for electronic commerce by developing e-cash which is divisible (e.g., a coin which can be spent incrementally but total purchases are limited to the monetary value of the coin). In Crypto`95, T. Okamoto presented the first practical divisible, untraceable, off-line e-cash scheme, which requires only O(log N) computations for each of the withdrawal, payment and deposit procedures, where N = (total coin value)/(smallest divisible unit). However, Okamoto`s set-up procedure is quite inefficient (on the order of 4,000 multi-exponentiations and depending on the size of the RSA modulus). The authors formalize the notion of range-bounded commitment, originally used in Okamoto`s account establishment protocol, and present a very efficient instantiation which allows one to construct the first truly efficient divisible e-cash system. The scheme only requires the equivalent of one (1) exponentiation for set-up, less than 2 exponentiations for withdrawal and around 20 for payment, while the size of the coin remains about 300 Bytes. Hence, the withdrawal protocol is 3 orders of magnitude faster than Okamoto`s, while the rest of the system remains equally efficient, allowing for implementation in smart-cards. Similar to Okamoto`s, the scheme is based on proofs whose cryptographic security assumptions are theoretically clarified.",

The key element in our appronch io a modular treatment of the authentication problem in cryptographic protocols; thii applies to the definition of accurity, to the design of the protocols, and to their analysis. In particulnr, following this modular approach, we show how to systematically transform solutions that work in a model of idaalizcd authenticated communications into solutions that are secure in the realistic setting of communication channels controlled by an active adversary. Using these principles we construct and prove the security of simple and practical authentication and key-exchange protocols. In particular, we provide a security analysis of aomo well-known key exchange protocols (e.g. authenticated Dlfllc-Hcllman key exchange), and of some of the techniques underlying the design of several authentication protocols that are currently being deployed on a large scale for the Intornot Protocol and other applications.",

We show that, with respect to these definitions, security is preserved under a natural composition operation. The definitions follow the general paradigm of known definitions; yet some substantial modifications and simplifications are introduced. The composition operation is the natural ``subroutine substitution'' operation, formalized by Micali and Rogaway. We consider several standard settings for multiparty protocols, including the cases of eavesdropping, Byzantine, nonadaptive and adaptive adversaries, as well as the information-theoretic and the computational models. In particular, in the computational model we provide the first definition of security of protocols that is shown to be preserved under composition.",

The new protocol resists dictionary attacks mounted by either passive or active network intruders, allowing, in principle, even weak passphrases to be used safely. It also o ers perfect forward secrecy, which protects past sessions and passwords against future compromises. Finally, user passwords are stored in a form that is not plaintext-equivalent to the password itself, so an attacker who captures the password database cannot use it directly to compromise security and gain immediate access to the host. This new protocol combines techniques of zero-knowledge proofs with asymmetric key exchange protocols and o ers signi cantly improved performance over comparably strong extended methods that resist stolen-veri er attacks such as Augmented EKE or B-SPEKE.",

The main building blocks of our protocols are statistical zero-knowledge proofs of knowledge that are of independent interest. We show how to prove the correct computation of a modular addition, a modular multiplication, and a modular exponentiation, where all values including the modulus are committed to but not publicly known. Apart from the validity of the equations, no other information about the modulus (e.g., a generator whose order equals the modulus) or any other operand is exposed. Our techniques can be generalized to prove that any multivariate modular polynomial equation is satisfied, where only commitments to the variables of the polynomial and to the modulus need to be known. This improves previous results, where the modulus is publicly known. We show how these building blocks allow to prove statements such as those listed earlier.",

Consequently, the String B-Tree overcomes the theoretical limitations of inverted files, B-trees, prefix B-trees, suffix arrays, compacted tries and suffix trees. String B-trees have the same worst-case performance as B-trees but they manage unbounded-length strings and perform much more powerful search operations such as the ones supported by suffix trees. String B-trees are also effective in main memory (RAM model) because they improve the online suffix tree search on a dynamic set of strings.

The following consequences of these relations reveal width as a crucial “resource” of Resolution proofs.\nIn one direction, the relations allow us to give simple, unified proofs for almost all known exponential lower bounds on size of resolution proofs, as well as several interesting new ones. They all follow from width lower bounds, and we show how these follow from natural expansion property of clauses of the input tautology.\nIn the other direction, the width-size relations naturally suggest a simple dynamic programming procedure for automated theorem proving—one which simply searches for small width proofs. This relation guarantees that the runnuing time (and thus the size of the produced proof) is at most quasi-polynomial in the smallest tree-like proof. This algorithm is never much worse than any of the recursive automated provers (such as DLL) used in practice. In contrast, we present a family of tautologies on which it is exponentially faster.",

      "abstract": "We introduce a novel approach to general secure multiparty computation that avoids the intensive use of verifiable secret sharing characterizing nearly all previous protocols in the literature. Instead, our scheme involves manipulation of ciphertexts for which the underlying private key is shared by participants in the computation. The benefits of this protocol include a high degree of conceptual and structural simplicity, low message complexity, and substantial flexibility with respect to input and output value formats. We refer to this new approach as mix and match. \n \nWhile the atomic operations in mix and match are logical operations, rather than full field operations as in previous approaches, the techniques we introduce are nonetheless highly practical for computations involving intensive bitwise manipulation. One application for which mix and match is particularly well suited is that of sealed-bid auctions. Thus, as another contribution in this paper, we present a practical, mix-and-match-based auction protocol that is fully private and non-interactive and may be readily adapted to a wide range of auction strategies.",

      "abstract": "We propose a novel paradigm for defining security of cryptographic protocols, called universally composable security. The salient property of universally composable definitions of security is that they guarantee security even when a secure protocol is composed of an arbitrary set of protocols, or more generally when the protocol is used as a component of an arbitrary system. This is an essential property for maintaining security of cryptographic protocols in complex and unpredictable environments such as the Internet. In particular, universally composable definitions guarantee security even when an unbounded number of protocol instances are executed concurrently in an adversarially controlled manner, they guarantee non-malleability with respect to arbitrary protocols, and more. We show how to formulate universally composable definitions of security for practically any cryptographic task. Furthermore, we demonstrate that practically any such definition can be realized using known techniques, as long as only a minority of the participants are corrupted. We then proceed to formulate universally composable definitions of a wide array of cryptographic tasks, including authenticated and secure communication, key-exchange, public-key encryption, signature, commitment, oblivious transfer, zero knowledge and more. We also make initial steps towards studying the realizability of the proposed definitions in various settings.",

In our model, two parties owning confidential databases wish to run a data mining algorithm on the union of their databases, without revealing any unnecessary information. This problem has many practical and important applications, such as in medical research with confidential patient records. \n \nData mining algorithms are usually complex, especially as the size of the input is measured in megabytes, if not gigabytes. A generic secure multi-party computation solution, based on evaluation of a circuit computing the algorithm on the entire input, is therefore of no practical use. We focus on the problem of decision tree learning and use ID3, a popular and widely used algorithm for this problem. We present a solution that is considerably more efficient than generic solutions. It demands very few rounds of communication and reasonable bandwidth. In our solution, each party performs by itself a computation of the same order as computing the ID3 algorithm for its own database. The results are then combined using efficient cryptographic protocols, whose overhead is only logarithmic in the number of transactions in the databases. We feel that our result is a substantial contribution, demonstrating that secure multi-party computation can be made practical, even for complex problems and large inputs.",

      "abstract": "One of the basic problems in cryptography is the generation of a common secret key between two parties, for instance in order to communicate privately. In this paper we consider information-theoretically secure key agreement. Wyner and subsequently Csiszar and Korner described and analyzed settings for secret-key agreement based on noisy communication channels. Maurer as well as Ahlswede and Csiszar generalized these models to a scenario based on correlated randomness and public discussion. In all these settings, the secrecy capacity and the secret-key rate, respectively, have been defined as the maximal achievable rates at which a highly-secret key can be generated by the legitimate partners. However, the privacy requirements were too weak in all these definitions, requiring only the ratio between the adversary's information and the length of the key to be negligible, but hence tolerating her to obtain a possibly substantial amount of information about the resulting key in an absolute sense. We give natural stronger definitions of secrecy capacity and secret-key rate, requiring that the adversary obtains virtually no information about the entire key. We show that not only secret-key agreement satisfying the strong secrecy condition is possible, but even that the achievable key-generation rates are equal to the previous weak notions of secrecy capacity and secret-key rate. Hence the unsatisfactory old definitions can be completely replaced by the new ones. We prove these results by a generic reduction of strong to weak key agreement. The reduction makes use of extractors, which allow to keep the required amount of communication negligible as compared to the length of the resulting key.",

      "abstract": "Abstract. The goal of secure multiparty computation is to transform a given protocol involving a trusted party into a protocol without need for the trusted party, by simulating the party among the players. Indeed, by the same means, one can simulate an arbitrary player in any given protocol. We formally define what it means to simulate a player by a multiparty protocol among a set of (new) players, and we derive the resilience of the new protocol as a function of the resiliences of the original protocol and the protocol used for the simulation. In contrast to all previous protocols that specify the tolerable adversaries by the number of corruptible players (a threshold), we consider general adversaries characterized by an adversary structure, a set of subsets of the player set, where the adversary may corrupt the players of one set in the structure. Recursively applying the simulation technique to standard threshold multiparty protocols results in protocols secure against general adversaries. The classical results in unconditional multiparty computation among a set of n players state that, in the passive model, any adversary that corrupts less than n/2 players can be tolerated, and in the active model, any adversary that corrupts less than n/3 players can be tolerated. Strictly generalizing these results we prove that, in the passive model, every function (more generally, every cooperation specified by involving a trusted party) can be computed securely with respect to a given adversary structure if and only if no two sets in the adversary structure cover the full set of players, and, in the active model, if and only if no three sets cover the full set of players. The complexities of the protocols are polynomial in the number of maximal adverse player sets in the adversary structure.",

The construction is based on 1) a formalization of the special multiplicative property of an LSSS that is needed to perform a multiplication on shared values, 2) an efficient generic construction to obtain from any LSSS a multiplicative LSSS for the same access structure, and 3) an efficient generic construction to build verifiability into every LSSS (always assuming that the adversary structure allows for MPC or VSS at all). \n \nThe protocols are efficient.

      "abstract": "Canetti and Fischlin have recently proposed the security notion universal composability for commitment schemes and provided two examples. This new notion is very strong. It guarantees that security is maintained even when an unbounded number of copies of the scheme are running concurrently, also it guarantees non-malleability and security against adaptive adversaries. Both proposed schemes use ?(k) bits to commit to one bit and can be based on the existence of trapdoor commitments and non-malleable encryption.We present new universally composable commitment (UCC) schemes based on extractable q one-way homomorphisms. These in turn exist based on the Paillier cryptosystem, the Okamoto-Uchiyama cryptosystem, or the DDH assumption. The schemes are efficient: to commit to k bits, they use a constant number of modular exponentiations and communicates O(k) bits. Furthermore the scheme can be instantiated in either perfectly hiding or perfectly binding versions. These are the first schemes to show that constant expansion factor, perfect hiding, and perfect binding can be obtained for universally composable commitments.We also show how the schemes can be applied to do efficient zero-knowledge proofs of knowledge that are universally composable.",

A simulator is an algorithm that tries to simulate the interaction of the adversary with an honest party, without knowing the private input of this honest party. Almost all known simulators use the adversary's algorithm as a black-box. We present the first constructions of non-black-box simulators. Using these new non-black-box techniques, we obtain several results that were previously proven to be impossible to obtain using black-box simulators. Specifically, assuming the existence of collision resistent hash functions, we construct a new zero-knowledge argument system for NP that satisfies the following properties: 1. This system has a constant number of rounds with negligible soundness error. 2. It remains zero knowledge even when composed concurrently n times, where n is the security parameter. Simultaneously obtaining 1 and 2 has been recently proven to be impossible to achieve using black-box simulators. 3. It is an Arthur-Merlin (public coins) protocol. Simultaneously obtaining 1 and 3 was known to be impossible to achieve with a black-box simulator. 4. It has a simulator that runs in strict polynomial time, rather than in expected polynomial time. All previously known constant-round, negligible-error zero-knowledge arguments utilized expected polynomial-time simulators.",

      "abstract": "In this paper we formalize the notion of a ring signature, which makes it possible to specify a set of possible signers without revealing which member actually produced the signature. Unlike group signatures, ring signatures have no group managers, no setup procedures, no revocation procedures, and no coordination: any user can choose any set of possible signers that includes himself, and sign any message by using his secret key and the others' public keys, without getting their approval or assistance. Ring signatures provide an elegant way to leak authoritative secrets in an anonymous way, to sign casual email in a way which can only be verified by its intended recipient, and to solve other problems in multiparty computations. The main contribution of this paper is a new construction of such signatures which is unconditionally signer-ambiguous, provably secure in the random oracle model, and exceptionally efficient: adding each ring member increases the cost of signing or verifying by a single modular multiplication and a single symmetric encryption.",

      "abstract": "We consider the question of protecting the privacy of customers buying digital goods. More specifically, our goal is to allow a buyer to purchase digital goods from a vendor without letting the vendor learn what, and to the extent possible also when and how much, it is buying. We propose solutions which allow the buyer, after making an initial deposit, to engage in an unlimited number of priced oblivious-transfer protocols, satisfying the following requirements: As long as the buyer's balance contains sufficient funds, it will successfully retrieve the selected item and its balance will be debited by the item's price. However, the buyer should be unable to retrieve an item whose cost exceeds its remaining balance. The vendor should learn nothing except what must inevitably be learned, namely, the amount of interaction and the initial deposit amount (which imply upper bounds on the quantity and total price of all information obtained by the buyer). In particular, the vendor should be unable to learn what the buyer's current balance is or when it actually runs out of its funds. \n \nThe technical tools we develop, in the process of solving this problem, seem to be of independent interest. In particular, we present the first one-round (two-pass) protocol for oblivious transfer that does not rely on the random oracle model (a very similar protocol was independently proposed by Naor and Pinkas [21]). This protocol is a special case of a more general \"conditional disclosure\" methodology, which extends a previous approach from [11] and adapts it to the 2-party setting.",

      "abstract": "One of the main challenges of securing multicast communicationis source authentication,or enabling receivers of multicast data to verify that the received data originated with the claimed source and was not modified enroute. The problem becomes more complex in common settings where other receivers of the data are not trusted, and where lost packets are not retransmitted. Several source authentication schemes for multicast have been suggested in the past, but none of these schemes is satisfactorily efficient in all prominent parameters. We recently proposed a very efficient scheme, TESLA, that is based on initial loose time synchronization between the sender and the receivers, followed by delayed release of keys by the sender. This paper proposes several substantial modifications and improvements to TESLA. One modification allows receivers to authenticate most packets as soon as they arrive (whereas TESLArequires buffering packets at the receiver side, and provides delayed authentication only). Other modifications improve the scalability of the scheme, reduce the space overhead for multiple instances, increase its resistance to denial-of-service attacks, and more.",

      "abstract": "Non-Interactive Zero Knowledge (NIZK), introduced by Blum, Feldman, and Micali in 1988, is a fundamental cryptographic primitive which has attracted considerable attention in the last decade and has been used throughout modern cryptography in several essential ways. For example, NIZK plays a central role in building provably secure public-key cryptosystems based on general complexity-theoretic assumptions that achieve security against chosen ciphertext attacks. In essence, in a multi-party setting, given a fixed common random string of polynomial size which is visible to all parties, NIZK allows an arbitrary polynomial number of Provers to send messages to polynomially many Verifiers, where each message constitutes an NIZK proof for an arbitrary polynomial-size NP statement. \n \nIn this paper, we take a closer look at NIZK in the multi-party setting. First, we consider non-malleable NIZK, and generalizing and substantially strengthening the results of Sahai, we give the first construction of NIZK which remains non-malleable after polynomially-many NIZK proofs. Second, we turn to the definition of standard NIZK itself, and propose a strengthening of it. In particular, one of the concerns in the technical definition of NIZK (as well as non-malleable NIZK) is that the so-called \"simulator\" of the Zero-Knowledge property is allowed to pick a different \"common random string\" from the one that Provers must actually use to prove NIZK statements in real executions. In this paper, we propose a new definition for NIZK that eliminates this shortcoming, and where Provers and the simulator use the same common random string. Furthermore, we show that both standard and non-malleable NIZK (as well as NIZK Proofs of Knowledge) can be constructed achieving this stronger definition. We call such NIZK Robust NIZK and show how to achieve it. Our results also yields the simplest known public-key encryption scheme based on general assumptions secure against adaptive chosen-ciphertext attack (CCA2).",

We investigate the anonymity of known encryption schemes. We prove that the El Gamal scheme provides anonymity under chosen-plaintext attack assuming the Decision Diffie-Hellman problem is hard and that the Cramer-Shoup scheme provides anonymity under chosen-ciphertext attack under the same assumption.

We show that any secure channels protocol designed to work with any combination of secure encryption (against chosen plaintext attacks) and secure MAC must use the encrypt-then-authenticate method. We demonstrate this by showing that the other common methods of composing encryption and authentication, including the authenticate-then-encrypt method used in SSL, are not generically secure. We show an example of an encryption function that provides (Shannon's) perfect secrecy but when combined with any MAC function under the authenticate-then-encrypt method yields a totally insecure protocol (for example, finding passwords or credit card numbers transmitted under the protection of such protocol becomes an easy task for an active attacker). The same applies to the encrypt-and-authenticate method used in SSH. \n \nOn the positive side we show that the authenticate-then-encrypt method is secure if the encryption method in use is either CBC mode (with an underlying secure block cipher) or a stream cipher (that xor the data with a random or pseudorandom pad). Thus, while we show the generic security of SSL to be broken, the current practical implementations of the protocol that use the above modes of encryption are safe.",

      "abstract": "Recently, Canetti and Krawczyk (Eurocrypt'2001) formulated a notion of security for key-exchange (ke) protocols, called SK-security, and showed that this notion suffices for constructing secure channels. However, their model and proofs do not suffice for proving more general composability properties of SK-secure ke protocols.We show that while the notion of SK-security is strictly weaker than a fully-idealized notion of key exchange security, it is sufficiently robust for providing secure composition with arbitrary protocols. In particular, SK-security guarantees the security of the key for any application that desires to set-up secret keys between pairs of parties. We also provide new definitions of secure-channels protocols with similarly strong composability properties, and show that SK-security suffices for obtaining these definitions.To obtain these results we use the recently proposed framework of \"universally composable (UC) security.\" We also use a new tool, called \"noninformation oracles,\" which will probably find applications beyond the present case. These tools allow us to bridge between seemingly limited indistinguishability-based definitions such as SK-security and more powerful, simulation-based definitions, such as UC security, where general composition theorems can be proven. Furthermore, based on such composition theorems we reduce the analysis of a full-fledged multi-session keyexchange protocol to the (simpler) analysis of individual, stand-alone, key-exchange sessions.",

Also, the job's service demand is not known a priori. We are particularly concerned with the case where the workload is heavy-tailed, as is characteristic of many empirically measured computer workloads. We analyze several natural task assignment policies and propose a new one TAGS (Task Assignment based on Guessing Size). The TAGS algorithm is counterintuitive in many respects, including load unbalancing, non-work-conserving, and fairness. We find that under heavy-tailed workloads, TAGS can outperform all task assignment policies known to us by several orders of magnitude with respect to both mean response time and mean slowdown, provided the system load is not too high. We also introduce a new practical performance metric for distributed servers called server expansion. Under the server expansion metric, TAGS significantly outperforms all other task assignment policies, regardless of system load.",

      "abstract": "Broadcast Encryption schemes enable a center to broadcast encrypted programs so that only designated subsets of users can decrypt each program. The stateless variant of this problem provides each user with a fixed set of keys which is never updated. The best scheme published so far for this problem is the \"subset difference\" (SD) technique of Naor Naor and Lotspiech, in which each one of the n users is initially given O(log2(n)) symmetric encryption keys. This allows the broadcaster to define at a later stage any subset of up to r users as \"revoked\", and to make the program accessible only to their complement by sending O(r) short messages before the encrypted program, and asking each user to perform an O(log(n)) computation. In this paper we describe the \"Layered Subset Difference\" (LSD) technique, which achieves the same goal with O(log1+?(n)) keys, O(r) messages, and O(log(n)) computation. This reduces the number of keys given to each user by almost a square root factor without affecting the other parameters. In addition, we show how to use the same LSD keys in order to address any subset defined by a nested combination of inclusion and exclusion conditions with a number of messages which is proportional to the complexity of the description rather than to the size of the subset. The LSD scheme is truly practical, and makes it possible to broadcast an unlimited number of programs to 256,000,000 possible customers by giving each new customer a smart card with one kilobyte of tamper-resistant memory. It is then possible to address any subset defined by t nested inclusion and exclusion conditions by sending less than 4t short messages, and the scheme remains secure even if all the other users form an adversarial coalition.",

We prove that when a particular initiator continues communication with a particular responder across path reformations, existing protocols are subject to the attack. We use this result to place an upper bound on how long existing protocols, including Crowds, Onion Routing, Hordes, Web Mixes, and DC-Net, can maintain anonymity in the face of the attacks described. Our results show that fully-connected DC-Net is the most resilient to these attacks, but it suffers from scalability issues that keep anonymity group sizes small.

      "abstract": "Broadcast authentication is a fundamental security service in distributed sensor networks. A scheme named $\\mu$TESLA has been proposed for efficient broadcast authentication in such networks. However, $\\mu$TESLA requires initial distribution of certain information based on unicast between the base station and each sensor node before the actual authentication of broadcast messages. Due to the limited bandwidth in wireless sensor networks, this initial unicast-based distribution severely limits the application of $\\mu$TESLA in large sensor networks. This paper presents a novel technique to replace the unicast-based initialization with a broadcast-based one. As a result, $\\mu$TESLA can be used in a sensor network with a large amount of sensors, as long as the message from the base station can reach these sensor nodes. This paper further explores several techniques that improve the performance, the robustness, as well as the security of the proposed method. The resulting protocol satisfies several nice properties, including low overhead, tolerance of message loss, scalability to large networks, and resistance to replay attacks as well as some known Denial of Service (DOS) attacks.",

We apply this framework to the problem of online routing of virtual circuits and to a dynamic data management problem. For both scenarios we achieve a competitive ratio of O(log/sup 3/ n) with respect to the congestion of the network links. Our online algorithm for the routing problem has the remarkable property that it is oblivious, i.e., the path chosen for a virtual circuit is independent of the current network load. Oblivious routing strategies can easily be implemented in distributed environments and have therefore been intensively studied for certain network topologies as e.g. meshes, tori and hypercubic networks.

In this paper we introduce the concept of an aggregate signature, present security models for such signatures, and give several applications for aggregate signatures. We construct an efficient aggregate signature from a recent short signature scheme based on bilinear maps due to Boneh, Lynn, and Shacham. Aggregate signatures are useful for reducing the size of certificate chains (by aggregating all signatures in the chain) and for reducing message size in secure routing protocols such as SBGP. We also show that aggregate signatures give rise to verifiably encrypted signatures. Such signatures enable the verifier to test that a given ciphertext C is the encryption of a signature on a given message M. Verifiably encrypted signatures are used in contract-signing protocols.

Rather than attempting to analyze the entire system as a single unit, we would like to be able to analyze each such protocol instance as stand-alone, and then use a general composition theorem to deduce the security of the entire system. However, no known composition theorem applies in this setting, since they all assume that the composed protocol instances have disjoint internal states, and that the internal random choices in the various executions are independent. We propose a new composition operation that can handle the case where different components have some amount of joint state and randomness, and demonstrate sufficient conditions for when the new operation preserves security.

Being a simpler and more compact alternative to suffix trees, it is an important tool for full text indexing and other string processing tasks. We introduce the skew algorithm for suffix array construction over integer alphabets that can be implemented to run in linear time using integer sorting as its only nontrivial subroutine: 1. recursively sort suffixes beginning at positions i mod 3 ≠ 0. 2. sort the remaining suffixes using the information obtained in step one. 3. merge the two sorted sequences obtained in steps one and two. \n \nThe algorithm is much simpler than previous linear time algorithms that are all based on the more complicated suffix tree data structure. Since sorting is a well studied problem, we obtain optimal algorithms for several other models of computation, e.g. external memory with parallel disks, cache oblivious, and parallel. The adaptations for BSP and EREW-PRAM are asymptotically faster than the best previously known algorithms.",

We show how to realize this in such a way that the size of the aggregate signature is independent of n. This makes sequential aggregate signatures a natural primitive for certificate chains, whose length can be reduced by aggregating all signatures in a chain.

We define and construct a mechanism that enables Alice to provide a key to the gateway that enables the gateway to test whether the word “urgent” is a keyword in the email without learning anything else about the email. We refer to this mechanism as Public Key Encryption with keyword Search. As another example, consider a mail server that stores various messages publicly encrypted for Alice by others. Using our mechanism Alice can send the mail server a key that will enable the server to identify all messages containing some specific keyword, but learn nothing else.

      "abstract": "Recently some efforts were made towards capturing the security requirements from digital signature schemes as an ideal functionality within a composable security framework. This modeling of digital signatures potentially has some significant analytical advantages (such as enabling component-wise analysis of complex systems that use signature schemes, as well as symbolic and automatable analysis of such systems). However, it turns out that formulating ideal functionalities that capture the properties expected from signature schemes in a way that is both sound and enjoys the above advantages is not a trivial task. This work has several contributions. We first correct some flaws in the definition of the ideal signature functionality of Canetti, 2001, and subsequent formulations. Next we provide a minimal formalization of \"ideal certification authorities\" and show how authenticated communication can be obtained using ideal signatures and an ideal certification authority. This is done while guaranteeing full modularity (i.e., each component is analyzed as stand-alone), and in an unconditional and errorless way. This opens the door to symbolic and automated analysis of protocols for these tasks, in a way that is both modular and cryptographically sound.",

In an effort to mitigate the damage caused by exposure of secret data (e.g., keys) stored on such devices, the paradigm of forward security was introduced. In a forward-secure scheme, secret keys are updated at regular periods of time; furthermore, exposure of a secret key corresponding to a given time period does not enable an adversary to \"break\" the scheme (in the appropriate sense) for any prior time period. A number of constructions of forward-secure digital signature schemes, key-exchange protocols, and symmetric-key schemes are known. \n \nWe present the first constructions of a (non-interactive) forward-secure public-key encryption scheme. Our main construction achieves security against chosen plaintext attacks under the decisional bilinear Diffie-Hellman assumption in the standard model. It is practical, and all complexity parameters grow at most logarithmically with the total number of time periods. The scheme can also be extended to achieve security against chosen ciphertext attacks.",

Recent work has shown that side channel attacks pose a serious threat to cryptosystems implemented in embedded devices. In this paper, we develop theoretical foundations for security against side channels. In particular, we propose several efficient techniques for building private circuits resisting this type of attacks.

In particular, a protocol proven secure in this framework is guaranteed to maintain its security even when deployed in arbitrary multi-party, multi-protocol, multi-execution environments. Protocols for securely carrying out essentially any cryptographic task in a universally composable way exist, both in the case of an honest majority (in the plain model, i.e., without set-up assumptions) and in the case of no honest majority (in the common reference string model). However, in the plain model, little was known for the case of no honest majority and, in particular, for the important special case of two-party protocols. \n \nWe study the feasibility of universally composable two-party function evaluation in the plain model. Our results show that very few functions can be computed in this model so as to provide the UC security guarantees. Specifically, for the case of deterministic functions, we provide a full characterization of the functions computable in this model. (Essentially, these are the functions that depend on at most one of the parties' inputs, and furthermore are \"efficiently invertible\" in a sense defined within.)

In order to retrieve documents satisfying a certain search criterion, the user gives the server a capability that allows the server to identify exactly those documents. Work in this area has largely focused on search criteria consisting of a single keyword. If the user is actually interested in documents containing each of several keywords (conjunctive keyword search) the user must either give the server capabilities for each of the keywords individually and rely on an intersection calculation (by either the server or the user) to determine the correct set of documents, or alternatively, the user may store additional information on the server to facilitate such searches. Neither solution is desirable; the former enables the server to learn which documents match each individual keyword of the conjunctive search and the latter results in exponential storage if the user allows for searches on every set of keywords.",

The user supplies a message M, key K, and initialization vector N, getting back the (one and only) associated ciphertext C = e N K(M). We concentrate on the case where the IV is guaranteed to be a nonce-something that takes on a new value with every message one encrypts. We explore definitions, constructions, and properties for nonce-based encryption. Symmetric encryption with a surfaced IV more directly captures real-word constructions like CBC mode, and encryption schemes constructed to be secure under nonce-based security notions may be less prone to misuse.",

      "abstract": "Despite previous efforts in auditing software manually and automatically, buffer overruns are still being discovered in programs in use. A dynamic bounds checker detects buffer overruns in erroneous software before it occurs and thereby prevents attacks from corrupting the integrity of the system. Dynamic buffer overrun detectors have not been adopted widely because they either (1) cannot guard against all buffer overrun attacks, (2) break existing code, or (3) incur too high an overhead. This paper presents a practical detector called CRED (C Range Error Detector) that avoids each of these deficiencies. CRED finds all buffer overrun attacks as it directly checks for the bounds of memory accesses. Unlike the original referent-object based bounds-checking technique, CRED does not break existing code because it uses a novel solution to support program manipulation of out-of-bounds addresses. Finally, by restricting the bounds checks to strings in a program, CRED’s overhead is greatly reduced without sacrificing protection in the experiments we performed. CRED is implemented as an extension of the GNU C compiler version 3.3.1. The simplicity of our design makes possible a robust implementation that has been tested on over 20 open-source programs, comprising over 1.2 million lines of C code. CRED proved effective in detecting buffer overrun attacks on programs with known vulnerabilities, and is the only tool found to guard against a testbed of 20 different buffer overflow attacks[34]. Finding overruns only on strings impose an overhead of less This research was performed while the first author was at Stanford University, and this material is based upon work supported in part by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 0086160. than 26% for 14 of the programs, and an overhead of up to 130% for the remaining six, while the previous state-ofthe-art bounds checker by Jones and Kelly breaks 60% of the programs and is 12 times slower. Incorporating wellknown techniques for optimizing bounds checking into CRED could lead to further performance improvements.",

      "abstract": "Sharing data between widely distributed intrusion detection systems offers the possibility of significant improvements in speed and accuracy over isolated systems. In this paper, we describe and evaluate DOMINO (Distributed Overlay for Monitoring InterNet Outbreaks); an architecture for a distributed intrusion detection system that fosters collaboration among heterogeneous nodes organized as an overlay network. The overlay design enables DOMINO to be heterogeneous, scalable, and robust to attacks and failures. An important component of DOMINO’s design is the use of active-sink nodes which respond to and measure connections to unused IP addresses. This enables efficient detection of attacks from spoofed IP sources, reduces false positives, enables attack classification and production of timely blacklists. We evaluate the capabilities and performance of DOMINO using a large set of intrusion logs collected from over 1600 providers across the Internet. Our analysis demonstrates the significant marginal benefit obtained from distributed intrusion data sources coordinated through a system like DOMINO. We also evaluate how to configure DOMINO in order to maximize performance gains from the perspectives of blacklist length, blacklist freshness and IP proximity. We perform a retrospective analysis on the 2002 SQL-Snake and 2003 SQL-Slammer epidemics that highlights how information exchange through DOMINO would have reduced the reaction time and false-alarm rates during outbreaks. Finally, we provide preliminary results from our prototype active-sink deployment that illustrates the limited variability in the sink traffic and the feasibility of efficient classification and discrimination of attack types. ∗The U.S. Government is authorized to reproduce and distribute reprints for Governmental purposes, notwithstanding any copyright notices affixed thereon.

DAA can be seen as a group signature without the feature that a signature can be opened, i.e., the anonymity is not revocable. Moreover, DAA allows for pseudonyms, i.e., for each signature a user (in agreement with the recipient of the signature) can decide whether or not the signature should be linkable to another signature. DAA furthermore allows for detection of \"known\" keys: if the DAA secret keys are extracted from a TPM and published, a verifier can detect that a signature was produced using these secret keys.

      "abstract": "We consider the problem of threshold secret sharing in groups with hierarchical structure. In such settings, the secret is shared among a group of participants that is partitioned into levels. The access structure is then determined by a sequence of threshold requirements: a subset of participants is authorized if it has at least k 0 members from the highest level, as well as at least k 1 > k 0 members from the two highest levels and so forth. Such problems may occur in settings where the participants differ in their authority or level of confidence and the presence of higher level participants is imperative to allow the recovery of the common secret. Even though secret sharing in hierarchical groups has been studied extensively in the past, none of the existing solutions addresses the simple setting where, say, a bank transfer should be signed by three employees, at least one of whom must be a department manager. We present a perfect secret sharing scheme for this problem that, unlike most secret sharing schemes that are suitable for hierarchical structures, is ideal. As in Shamir’s scheme, the secret is represented as the free coefficient of some polynomial. The novelty of our scheme is the usage of polynomial derivatives in order to generate lesser shares for participants of lower levels. Consequently, our scheme uses Birkhoff interpolation, i.e., the construction of a polynomial according to an unstructured set of point and derivative values. A substantial part of our discussion is dedicated to the question of how to assign identities to the participants from the underlying finite field so that the resulting Birkhoff interpolation problem will be well posed. In the course of this discussion, we borrow some results from the theory of Birkhoff interpolation over ℝ and import them to the context of finite fields.",

      "abstract": "We consider the following problem: a user $\\mathcal{U}$ wants to store his files in an encrypted form on a remote file server $\\mathcal{S}$. Later the user $\\mathcal{U}$ wants to efficiently retrieve some of the encrypted files containing (or indexed by) specific keywords, keeping the keywords themselves secret and not jeopardizing the security of the remotely stored files. For example, a user may want to store old e-mail messages encrypted on a server managed by Yahoo or another large vendor, and later retrieve certain messages while travelling with a mobile device. \n \nIn this paper, we offer solutions for this problem under well-defined security requirements. Our schemes are efficient in the sense that no public-key cryptosystem is involved. Indeed, our approach is independent of the encryption method chosen for the remote files. They are also incremental, in that $\\mathcal{U}$ can submit new files which are secure against previous queries but still searchable against future queries.",

      "abstract": "The ability to link two different sightings of the same Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tag enables invasions of privacy. The problem is aggravated when an item, and the tag attached to it, changes hands during the course of its lifetime. After such an ownership transfer, the new owner should be able to read the tag but the old owner should not. \n \nWe address these issues through an RFID pseudonym protocol. Each time it is queried, the RFID tag emits a different pseudonym using a pseudo-random function. Without consent of a special Trusted Center that shares secrets with the tag, it is infeasible to map the pseudonym to the tag's real identity. We present a scheme for RFID pseudonyms that works with legacy, untrusted readers, requires only one message from tag to reader, and is scalable: decoding tag pseudonyms takes work logarithmic in the number of tags. Our scheme further allows for time-limited delegation, so that we can give an RFID reader the power to disambiguate a limited number of pseudonyms without further help from the Trusted Center. We show how RFID pseudonyms facilitate the transfer of ownership of RFID tags between mutually distrustful parties. \n \nOur scheme requires only limited cryptographic functionality from the tag: we need a pseudo-random function (PRF) and the ability to update tag state or to generate random numbers. Tag storage and communication requirements are modest: we give example parameters for a deployment of one million tags in which each tag stores only 128 bits, makes 6 PRF evaluations, and sends 158 bits each time it is read.",

Unfortunately, construction of Certificateless Public Key Encryption (CLPKE) schemes has so far depended on the use of Identity-Based Encryption, which results in the bilinear pairing-based schemes that need costly operations. In this paper, we consider a relaxation of the original model of CLPKE and propose a new CLPKE scheme that does not depend on the bilinear pairings.

A point function is a Boolean function that assumes the value 1 at exactly one point. Our main results are as follows:We provide a simple construction of efficient obfuscators for point functions for a slightly relaxed notion of obfuscation, for which obfuscating general circuits is nonetheless impossible. Our construction relies on the existence of a very strong one-way permutation, and yields the first non-trivial obfuscator under general assumptions in the standard model. We also obtain obfuscators for point functions with multi-bit output and for prefix matching.Our assumption is that there is a one-way permutation wherein any polynomial-sized circuit inverts the permutation on at most a polynomial number of inputs. We show that a similar assumption is in fact necessary, and that our assumption holds relative to a random permutation oracle.Finally, we establish two impossibility results which indicate that the limitations on our construction, namely simulating only adversaries with single-bit output and using nonuniform advice in our simulator, are in some sense inherent.Previous work gave negative results for the general class of circuits (Barak et al., Crypto '01) and positive results in the random oracle model (Lynn et al., Eurocrypt '04) or under non-standard number-theoretic assumptions (Canetti, Crypto '97).

While one protocol is more suitable to scenarios in which the password is shared across several servers, the other enjoys better security properties. Both protocols are as efficient, if not better, as any of the existing encrypted key exchange protocols in the literature, and yet they only require a single random oracle instance. The proof of security for both protocols is in the random oracle model and based on hardness of the computational Diffie-Hellman problem. However, some of the techniques that we use are quite different from the usual ones and make use of new variants of the Diffie-Hellman problem, which are of independent interest.

In addition to security, we also provide a framework for quantifying the efficiency and checkability of an outsourcing implementation. We present two practical outsource-secure schemes. Specifically, we show how to securely outsource modular exponentiation, which presents the computational bottleneck in most public-key cryptography on computationally limited devices. Without outsourcing, a device would need O(n) modular multiplications to carry out modular exponentiation for n-bit exponents. The load reduces to O(log2n) for any exponentiation-based scheme where the honest device may use two untrusted exponentiation programs; we highlight the Cramer-Shoup cryptosystem [13] and Schnorr signatures [28] as examples. With a relaxed notion of security, we achieve the same load reduction for a new CCA2-secure encryption scheme using only one untrusted Cramer-Shoup encryption program.",

Each party's input to the function is his private input multiset. In order to protect these private sets, the players perform privacy-preserving computation; that is, no party learns more information about other parties' private input sets than what can be deduced from the result. In this paper, we propose efficient techniques for privacy-preserving operations on multisets. By building a framework of multiset operations, employing the mathematical properties of polynomials, we design efficient, secure, and composable methods to enable privacy-preserving computation of the union, intersection, and element reduction operations.

Subsequent work of Boyen has shown how to extend these techniques, in the random oracle model, to enable unidirectional authentication from the user to the server without the assumption of a reliable communication channel. \n \nWe show two efficient techniques enabling the use of biometric data to achieve mutual authentication or authenticated key exchange over a completely insecure (i.e., adversarially controlled) channel.

      "abstract": "Ring signatures, first introduced by Rivest, Shamir, and Tauman, enable a user to sign a message so that a ring of possible signers (of which the user is a member) is identified, without revealing exactly which member of that ring actually generated the signature. In contrast to group signatures, ring signatures are completely “ad-hoc” and do not require any central authority or coordination among the various users (indeed, users do not even need to be aware of each other); furthermore, ring signature schemes grant users fine-grained control over the level of anonymity associated with any particular signature. \n \nThis paper has two main areas of focus. First, we examine previous definitions of security for ring signature schemes and suggest that most of these prior definitions are too weak, in the sense that they do not take into account certain realistic attacks. We propose new definitions of anonymity and unforgeability which address these threats, and then give separation results proving that our new notions are strictly stronger than previous ones. Next, we show two constructions of ring signature schemes in the standard model: one based on generic assumptions which satisfies our strongest definitions of security, and a second, more efficient scheme achieving weaker security guarantees and more limited functionality. These are the first constructions of ring signature schemes that do not rely on random oracles or ideal ciphers.",

However, while for interactive zero-knowledge we know how to construct statistical zero-knowledge argument systems for all NP languages, for non-interactive zero-knowledge, this problem remained open since the inception of NIZK in the late 1980's.

      "abstract": "We continue a line of research initiated in [10, 11] on privacy-preserving statistical databases. Consider a trusted server that holds a database of sensitive information. Given a query function f mapping databases to reals, the so-called true answer is the result of applying f to the database. To protect privacy, the true answer is perturbed by the addition of random noise generated according to a carefully chosen distribution, and this response, the true answer plus noise, is returned to the user. Previous work focused on the case of noisy sums, in which f = Σ i g(x i ), where x i denotes the ith row of the database and g maps database rows to [0,1]. We extend the study to general functions f, proving that privacy can be preserved by calibrating the standard deviation of the noise according to the sensitivity of the function f. Roughly speaking, this is the amount that any single argument to f can change its output. The new analysis shows that for several particular applications substantially less noise is needed than was previously understood to be the case. The first step is a very clean characterization of privacy in terms of indistinguishability of transcripts. Additionally, we obtain separation results showing the increased value of interactive sanitization mechanisms over non-interactive.",

However, subsequent attacks showed that assumption (2) is false for MD5 and SHA-1, removing the proof-based support for HMAC in these cases. This paper proves that HMAC is a PRF under the sole assumption that the compression function is a PRF. This recovers a proof-based guarantee since no known attacks compromise the pseudorandomness of the compression function, and it also helps explain the resistance to attack that HMAC has shown even when implemented with hash functions whose (weak) collision resistance is compromised. We also show that an even weaker than PRF condition on the compression function, namely that it is a privacy-preserving MAC, suffices to establish HMAC is a secure MAC as long as the hash function meets the very weak requirement of being computationally almost universal, where again the value lies in the fact that known attacks do not invalidate the assumptions made.",

      "abstract": "RFID technology arouses great interests from both its advocates and opponents because of the promising but privacy-threatening nature of low-cost RFID tags. A main privacy concern in RFID systems results from clandestine scanning through which an adversary could conduct silent tracking and inventorying of persons carrying tagged objects. Thus, the most important security requirement in designing RFID protocols is to ensure untraceability of RFID tags by unauthorized parties (even with knowledge of a tag secret due to no physical security of low-cost RFID tags). Previous work in this direction mainly focuses on backward untraceability, requiring that compromise of a tag secret should not help identify the tag from past communication transcripts. However, in this paper, we argue that forward untraceability, i.e., untraceability of future events even with knowledge of a current tag secret, should be considered as an equally or even more important security property in RFID protocol designs. Furthermore, RFID tags may often change hands during their lifetime and thus the problem of tag ownership transfer should be dealt with as another key issue in RFID privacy problems; once ownership of a tag is transferred to another party, the old owner should not be able to read the tag any more. It is rather obvious that complete transfer of tag ownership is possible only if some degree of forward untraceability is provided. We propose a strong and robust RFID authentication protocol satisfying both forward and backward untraceability and enabling complete transfer of tag ownership.",

      "abstract": "We propose the model of nested words for representation of data with both a linear ordering and a hierarchically nested matching of items. Examples of data with such dual linear-hierarchical structure include executions of structured programs, annotated linguistic data, and HTML/XML documents. Nested words generalize both words and ordered trees, and allow both word and tree operations. We define nested word automata—finite-state acceptors for nested words, and show that the resulting class of regular languages of nested words has all the appealing theoretical properties that the classical regular word languages enjoys: deterministic nested word automata are as expressive as their nondeterministic counterparts; the class is closed under union, intersection, complementation, concatenation, Kleene-*, prefixes, and language homomorphisms; membership, emptiness, language inclusion, and language equivalence are all decidable; and definability in monadic second order logic corresponds exactly to finite-state recognizability. We also consider regular languages of infinite nested words and show that the closure properties, MSO-characterization, and decidability of decision problems carry over.\n The linear encodings of nested words give the class of visibly pushdown languages of words, and this class lies between balanced languages and deterministic context-free languages. We argue that for algorithmic verification of structured programs, instead of viewing the program as a context-free language over words, one should view it as a regular language of nested words (or equivalently, a visibly pushdown language), and this would allow model checking of many properties (such as stack inspection, pre-post conditions) that are not expressible in existing specification logics.\n We also study the relationship between ordered trees and nested words, and the corresponding automata: while the analysis complexity of nested word automata is the same as that of classical tree automata, they combine both bottom-up and top-down traversals, and enjoy expressiveness and succinctness benefits over tree automata.",

Our scheme is also the first receipt-free scheme to give “everlasting privacy” for votes: even a computationally unbounded party does not gain any information about individual votes (other than what can be inferred from the final tally). \n \nOur voting protocols are designed to be used in a “traditional” setting, in which voters cast their ballots in a private polling booth (which we model as an untappable channel between the voter and the tallying authority). Following in the footsteps of Chaum and Neff [7,16], our protocol ensures that the integrity of an election cannot be compromised even if the computers running it are all corrupt (although ballot secrecy may be violated in this case). \n \nWe give a generic voting protocol which we prove to be secure in the Universal Composability model, given that the underlying commitment is universally composable. We also propose a concrete implementation, based on the hardness of discrete log, that is slightly more efficient (and can be used in practice).",

One drawback of encrypting data, is that it can be selectively shared only at a coarse-grained level (i.e., giving another party your private key). We develop a new cryptosystem for fine-grained sharing of encrypted data that we call Key-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (KP-ABE). In our cryptosystem, ciphertexts are labeled with sets of attributes and private keys are associated with access structures that control which ciphertexts a user is able to decrypt.

      "abstract": "In this work we provide efficient distributed protocols for generating shares of random noise, secure against malicious participants. The purpose of the noise generation is to create a distributed implementation of the privacy-preserving statistical databases described in recent papers [14,4,13]. In these databases, privacy is obtained by perturbing the true answer to a database query by the addition of a small amount of Gaussian or exponentially distributed random noise. The computational power of even a simple form of these databases, when the query is just of the form ∑if(di), that is, the sum over all rows i in the database of a function f applied to the data in row i, has been demonstrated in [4]. A distributed implementation eliminates the need for a trusted database administrator. \n \nThe results for noise generation are of independent interest. The generation of Gaussian noise introduces a technique for distributing shares of many unbiased coins with fewer executions of verifiable secret sharing than would be needed using previous approaches (reduced by a factor of n). The generation of exponentially distributed noise uses two shallow circuits: one for generating many arbitrarily but identically biased coins at an amortized cost of two unbiased random bits apiece, independent of the bias, and the other to combine bits of appropriate biases to obtain an exponential distribution.",

In contrast, all previous works on protecting cryptographic hardware relied on an assumption that some portion of the circuit must remain completely free from tampering. \n \nWe obtain the first feasibility results for such private circuits. Our main result is an efficient transformation of a circuit C, realizing an arbitrary (reactive) functionality, into a private circuit C′ realizing the same functionality.

      "abstract": "Cryptographic protocols are often designed and analyzed under some trusted set-up assumptions, namely in settings where the participants have access to global information that is trusted to have some basic security properties. However, current modeling of security in the presence of such set-up falls short of providing the expected security guarantees. A quintessential example of this phenomenon is the deniability concern: there exist natural protocols that meet the strongest known composable security notions, and are still vulnerable to bad interactions with rogue protocols that use the same set-up. \n \nWe extend the notion of universally composable (UC) security in a way that re-establishes its original intuitive guarantee even for protocols that use globally available set-up. The new formulation prevents bad interactions even with adaptively chosen protocols that use the same set-up. In particular, it guarantees deniability. While for protocols that use no setup the proposed requirements are the same as in traditional UC security, for protocols that use global set-up the proposed requirements are significantly stronger. In fact, realizing Zero Knowledge or commitment becomes provably impossible, even in the Common Reference String model. Still, we propose reasonable alternative set-up assumptions and protocols that allow realizing practically any cryptographic task under standard hardness assumptions even against adaptive corruptions.",

Obfuscation has applications for cryptography and for software protection. \n \nBarak et al. initiated a theoretical study of obfuscation, which focused on black-box obfuscation, where the obfuscated circuit should leak no information except for its (black-box) input-output functionality. A family of functionalities that cannot be obfuscated was demonstrated. Subsequent research has showed further negative results as well as positive results for obfuscating very specific families of circuits, all with respect to black box obfuscation. \n \nThis work is a study of a new notion of obfuscation, which we call best-possible obfuscation. Best possible obfuscation makes the relaxed requirement that the obfuscated program leaks as little information as any other program with the same functionality (and of similar size). In particular, this definition allows the program to leak non black-box information. Best-possible obfuscation guarantees that any information that is not hidden by the obfuscated program is also not hidden by any other similar-size program computing the same functionality, and thus the obfuscation is (literally) the best possible. In this work we study best-possible obfuscation and its relationship to previously studied definitions. Our main results are: 1. A separation between black-box and best-possible obfuscation. We show a natural obfuscation task that can be achieved under the best-possible definition, but cannot be achieved under the black-box definition. 2. A hardness result for best-possible obfuscation, showing that strong (information-theoretic) best-possible obfuscation implies a collapse in the polynomial hierarchy. 3. An impossibility result for efficient best-possible (and black-box) obfuscation in the presence of random oracles. This impossibility result uses a random oracle to construct hard-to-obfuscate circuits, and thus it does not imply impossibility in the standard model.",

      "abstract": "In the setting of secure multiparty computation, a set of mutually distrustful parties wish to securely compute some joint function of their private inputs. The computation should be carried out in a secure way, meaning that no coalition of corrupted parties should be able to learn more than specified or somehow cause the result to be \"incorrect\". Typically, corrupted parties are either assumed to be semi-honest (meaning that they follow the protocol specification) or malicious (meaning that they may deviate arbitrarily from the protocol). However, in many settings, the assumption regarding semi-honest behavior does not suffice and security in the presence of malicious adversaries is excessive and expensive to achieve. \n \nIn this paper, we introduce the notion of covert adversaries, which we believe faithfully models the adversarial behavior in many commercial, political, and social settings. Covert adversaries have the property that they may deviate arbitrarily from the protocol specification in an attempt to cheat, but do not wish to be \"caught\" doing so. We provide a definition of security for covert adversaries and show that it is possible to obtain highly efficient protocols that are secure against such adversaries. We stress that in our definition, we quantify over all (possibly malicious) adversaries and do not assume that the adversary behaves in any particular way. Rather, we guarantee that if an adversary deviates from the protocol in a way that would enable it to \"cheat\", then the honest parties are guaranteed to detect this cheating with good probability. We argue that this level of security is sufficient in many settings.",

      "abstract": "In multiagent settings where the agents have different preferences, preference aggregation is a central issue. Voting is a general method for preference aggregation, but seminal results have shown that all general voting protocols are manipulable. One could try to avoid manipulation by using protocols where determining a beneficial manipulation is hard. Especially among computational agents, it is reasonable to measure this hardness by computational complexity. Some earlier work has been done in this area, but it was assumed that the number of voters and candidates is unbounded. Such hardness results lose relevance when the number of candidates is small, because manipulation algorithms that are exponential only in the number of candidates (and only slightly so) might be available. We give such an algorithm for an individual agent to manipulate the Single Transferable Vote (STV) protocol, which has been shown hard to manipulate in the above sense. This motivates the core of this article, which derives hardness results for realistic elections where the number of candidates is a small constant (but the number of voters can be large).\n The main manipulation question we study is that of coalitional manipulation by weighted voters. (We show that for simpler manipulation problems, manipulation cannot be hard with few candidates.) We study both constructive manipulation (making a given candidate win) and destructive manipulation (making a given candidate not win). We characterize the exact number of candidates for which manipulation becomes hard for the plurality, Borda, STV, Copeland, maximin, veto, plurality with runoff, regular cup, and randomized cup protocols. We also show that hardness of manipulation in this setting implies hardness of manipulation by an individual in unweighted settings when there is uncertainty about the others' votes (but not vice-versa). To our knowledge, these are the first results on the hardness of manipulation when there is uncertainty about the others' votes.",

Furthermore, the protocols can provide statisticalsecurity to either the sender or the receiver, simply by changing the distribution of the common string. For certain instantiations of the protocol, even a common uniformly randomstring suffices. \n \nOur key technical contribution is a simple abstraction that we call a dual-modecryptosystem. We implement dual-mode cryptosystems by taking a unified view of several cryptosystems that have what we call \"messy\" public keys, whose defining property is that a ciphertext encrypted under such a key carries no information(statistically) about the encrypted message. \n \nAs a contribution of independent interest, we also provide a multi-bit amortizedversion of Regev's lattice-based cryptosystem (STOC 2005) whose time and space complexity are improved by a linear factor in the security parameter n. The resulting amortized encryption and decryption times are only $\\tilde{O}(n)$ bit operations per message bit, and the ciphertext expansion can be made as small as a constant; the public key size and underlying lattice assumption remain essentially the same.",

Storage is private in the sense that an adversary does not have read access to Σ(G) at all. However, Σ(G) is non-robust in the sense that the adversary can modify its contents by adding some offset Δ ∈ G. Due to the privacy of the storage device, the value Δ can only depend on an adversary's a priori knowledge of x. We introduce a new primitive called an algebraic manipulation detection (AMD) code, which encodes a source s into a value x stored on Σ(G) so that any tampering by an adversary will be detected. We give a nearly optimal construction of AMD codes, which can flexibly accommodate arbitrary choices for the length of the source s and security level. We use this construction in two applications: - We show how to efficiently convert any linear secret sharing scheme into a robust secret sharing scheme, which ensures that no unqualified subset of players can modify their shares and cause the reconstruction of some value s′ ≠ s. - We show how to build nearly optimal robust fuzzy extractors for several natural metrics. Robust fuzzy extractors enable one to reliably extract and later recover random keys from noisy and non-uniform secrets, such as biometrics, by relying only on non-robust public storage. In the past, such constructions were known only in the random oracle model, or required the entropy rate of the secret to be greater than half.

      "abstract": "We show an efficient secure two-party protocol, based on Yao’s construction, which provides security against malicious adversaries. Yao’s original protocol is only secure in the presence of semi-honest adversaries, and can be transformed into a protocol that achieves security against malicious adversaries by applying the compiler of Goldreich, Micali, and Wigderson (the “GMW compiler”). However, this approach does not seem to be very practical as it requires using generic zero-knowledge proofs. Our construction is based on applying cut-and-choose techniques to the original circuit and inputs. Security is proved according to the ideal/real simulation paradigm, and the proof is in the standard model (with no random oracle model or common reference string assumptions). The resulting protocol is computationally efficient: the only usage of asymmetric cryptography is for running $$O(1)$$O(1) oblivious transfers for each input bit (or for each bit of a statistical security parameter, whichever is larger). Our protocol combines techniques from folklore (like cut-and-choose) along with new techniques for efficiently proving consistency of inputs. We remark that a naive implementation of the cut-and-choose technique with Yao’s protocol does not yield a secure protocol. This is the first paper to show how to properly implement these techniques, and to provide a full proof of security. Our protocol can also be interpreted as a constant-round black-box reduction of secure two-party computation to oblivious transfer and perfectly hiding commitments, or a black-box reduction of secure two-party computation to oblivious transfer alone, with a number of rounds which is linear in a statistical security parameter. These two reductions are comparable to Kilian’s (20th STOC, 1988) reduction, which uses OT alone but incurs a number of rounds which is linear in the depth of the circuit.",

The senders using an IBE do not need to look up the public keys and the corresponding certificates of the receivers, the identities (e.g. emails or IP addresses) of the latter are sufficient to encrypt. Any setting, PKI- or identity-based, must provide a means to revoke users from the system. Efficient revocation is a well-studied problem in the traditional PKI setting. However in the setting of IBE, there has been little work on studying the revocation mechanisms. The most practical solution requires the senders to also use time periods when encrypting, and all the receivers (regardless of whether their keys have been compromised or not) to update their private keys regularly by contacting the trusted authority. We note that this solution does not scale well -- as the number of users increases, the work on key updates becomes a bottleneck. We propose an IBE scheme that significantly improves key-update efficiency on the side of the trusted party (from linear to logarithmic in the number of users), while staying efficient for the users. Our scheme builds on the ideas of the Fuzzy IBE primitive and binary tree data structure, and is provably secure.",

      "abstract": "The success of electronic authentication systems, be it e-ID card systems or Internet authentication systems such as CardSpace, highly depends on the provided level of user-privacy. Thereby, an important requirement is an efficient means for revocation of the authentication credentials. In this paper we consider the problem of revocation for certificate-based privacy-protecting authentication systems. To date, the most efficient solutions for revocation for such systems are based on cryptographic accumulators. Here, an accumulate of all currently valid certificates is published regularly and each user holds a witness enabling her to prove the validity of her (anonymous) credential while retaining anonymity. Unfortunately, the users' witnesses must be updated at least each time a credential is revoked. For the know solutions, these updates are computationally very expensive for users and/or certificate issuers which is very problematic as revocation is a frequent event as practice shows. \n \nIn this paper, we propose a new dynamic accumulator scheme based on bilinear maps and show how to apply it to the problem of revocation of anonymous credentials. In the resulting scheme, proving a credential's validity and updating witnesses both come at (virtually) no cost for credential owners and verifiers. In particular, updating a witness requires the issuer to do only one multiplication per addition or revocation of a credential and can also be delegated to untrusted entities from which a user could just retrieve the updated witness. We believe that thereby we provide the first authentication system offering privacy protection suitable for implementation with electronic tokens such as eID cards or drivers' licenses.",

In this paper, we consider a new notion called predicate privacy , the property that tokens reveal no information about the encoded query predicate. Predicate privacy is inherently impossible to achieve in the public-key setting and has therefore received little attention in prior work. In this work, we consider predicate encryption in the symmetric-key setting and present a symmetric-key predicate encryption scheme which supports inner product queries.

Due to their inherent dependency on the physical properties of the device that contains them, they can be used to uniquely bind an application to a particular device for the purpose of IP protection. This is crucial for the protection of FPGA applications against illegal copying and distribution. In order to exploit the physical nature of PUFs for reliable cryptography a so-called helper data algorithm or fuzzy extractor is used to generate cryptographic keys with appropriate entropy from noisy and non-uniform random PUF responses. In this paper we present for the first time efficient implementations of fuzzy extractors on FPGAs where the efficiency is measured in terms of required hardware resources. This fills the gap of the missing building block for a full FPGA IP protection solution. Moreover, in this context we propose new architectures for the decoders of Reed-Muller and Golay codes, and show that our solutions are very attractive from both the area and error correction capability points of view.",

In contrast to traditional routing schemes, however, network coding requires intermediate nodes to modify data packets en route ; for this reason, standard signature schemes are inapplicable and it is a challenge to provide resilience to tampering by malicious nodes. \n \nWe propose two signature schemes that can be used in conjunction with network coding to prevent malicious modification of data. Our schemes can be viewed as signing linear subspaces in the sense that a signature *** on a subspace V authenticates exactly those vectors in V . Our first scheme is (suitably) homomorphic and has constant public-key size and per-packet overhead.

      "abstract": "We consider the problem of efficiently proving the integrity of data stored at untrusted servers. In the provable data possession (PDP) model, the client preprocesses the data and then sends it to an untrusted server for storage, while keeping a small amount of meta-data. The client later asks the server to prove that the stored data has not been tampered with or deleted (without downloading the actual data). However, the original PDP scheme applies only to static (or append-only) files.\n We present a definitional framework and efficient constructions for dynamic provable data possession (DPDP), which extends the PDP model to support provable updates to stored data. We use a new version of authenticated dictionaries based on rank information. The price of dynamic updates is a performance change from O(1) to O(logn) (or O(nεlog n), for a file consisting of n blocks, while maintaining the same (or better, respectively) probability of misbehavior detection. Our experiments show that this slowdown is very low in practice (e.g. 415KB proof size and 30ms computational overhead for a 1GB file). We also show how to apply our DPDP scheme to outsourced file systems and version control systems (e.g. CVS).",

      "abstract": "In this work, we introduce one-time programs, a new computational paradigm geared towards security applications. A one-time program can be executed on a single input, whose value can be specified at run time. Other than the result of the computation on this input, nothing else about the program is leaked. Hence, a one-time program is like a black box function that may be evaluated once and then “self destructs.” This also extends to k-time programs, which are like black box functions that can be evaluated k times and then self destruct. One-time programs serve many of the same purposes of program obfuscation, the obvious one being software protection, but also including applications such as temporary transfer of cryptographic ability. Moreover, the applications of one-time programs go well beyond those of obfuscation, since one-time programs can only be executed once (or more generally, a limited number of times) while obfuscated programs have no such bounds. For example, one-time programs lead naturally to electronic cash or token schemes: coins are generated by a program that can only be run once, and thus cannot be double spent. Most significantly, the new paradigm of one-time computing opens new avenues for conceptual research. In this work we explore one such avenue, presenting the new concept of “one-time proofs,” proofs that can only be verified once and then become useless and unconvincing. All these tasks are clearly impossible using software alone, as any piece of software can be copied and run again, enabling the user to execute the program on more than one input. All our solutions employ a secure memory device, inspired by the cryptographic notion of interactive oblivious transfer protocols, that stores two secret keys (k0, k1). The device takes as input a single bit b ∈ {0, 1}, outputs kb, and then self destructs. Using such devices, we demonstrate that for every input length, any standard program (Turing machine) can be efficiently compiled into a functionally equivalent one-time program. We also show how this memory device can be used to construct one-time proofs. Specifically, we show how to use this device to efficiently convert a classical witness for any NP statement, into “one-time proof” for that statement. ?

We focus on constructing efficient deterministic encryption schemes withoutrandom oracles. To do so, we propose a slightly weaker notion of security, saying that no partial information about encrypted messages should be leaked as long as each message is a-priori hard-to-guess given the others(while PRIV did not have the latter restriction). Nevertheless, we argue that this version seems adequate for many practical applications. We show equivalence of this definition to single-message and indistinguishability-based ones, which are easier to work with. Then we give general constructions of both chosen-plaintext (CPA) and chosen-ciphertext-attack (CCA) secure deterministic encryption schemes, as well as efficient instantiations of them under standard number-theoretic assumptions.

Privacy can be rigorously quantified using the framework of differential privacy, which requires that a mechanism's output distribution is nearly the same whether or not a given database row is included or excluded. The goal of this paper is strong and general utility guarantees, subject to differential privacy. We pursue mechanisms that guarantee near-optimal utility to every potential user, independent of its side information (modeled as a prior distribution over query results) and preferences (modeled via a loss function). Our main result is: for each fixed count query and differential privacy level, there is a geometric mechanism M* -- a discrete variant of the simple and well-studied Laplace mechanism -- that is simultaneously expected loss-minimizing for every possible user, subject to the differential privacy constraint. This is an extremely strong utility guarantee: every potential user u, no matter what its side information and preferences, derives as much utility from M* as from interacting with a differentially private mechanism Mu that is optimally tailored to u. More precisely, for every user u there is an optimal mechanism Mu for it that factors into a user-independent part (the geometric mechanism M*) followed by user-specific post-processing that can be delegated to the user itself. The first part of our proof of this result characterizes the optimal differentially private mechanism for a fixed but arbitrary user in terms of a certain basic feasible solution to a linear program with constraints that encode differential privacy. The second part shows that all of the relevant vertices of this polytope (ranging over all possible users) are derivable from the geometric mechanism via suitable remappings of its range.",

      "abstract": "Storage outsourcing is a rising trend which prompts a number of interesting security issues, many of which have been extensively investigated in the past. However, Provable Data Possession (PDP) is a topic that has only recently appeared in the research literature. The main issue is how to frequently, efficiently and securely verify that a storage server is faithfully storing its client's (potentially very large) outsourced data. The storage server is assumed to be untrusted in terms of both security and reliability. (In other words, it might maliciously or accidentally erase hosted data; it might also relegate it to slow or off-line storage.) The problem is exacerbated by the client being a small computing device with limited resources. Prior work has addressed this problem using either public key cryptography or requiring the client to outsource its data in encrypted form.\n In this paper, we construct a highly efficient and provably secure PDP technique based entirely on symmetric key cryptography, while not requiring any bulk encryption. Also, in contrast with its predecessors, our PDP technique allows outsourcing of dynamic data, i.e, it efficiently supports operations, such as block modification, deletion and append.",

The previous construction of Boneh, Boyen, and Goh was only proven to be secure in the selective model, under a non-static assumption which depended on the depth of the hierarchy. To obtain full security, we apply the dual system encryption concept recently introduced by Waters. A straightforward application of this technique is insufficient to achieve short ciphertexts, since the original instantiation of the technique includes tags that do not compress. To overcome this challenge, we design a new method for realizing dual system encryption. We provide a system in composite order groups (of three primes) and prove the security of our (first) scheme under three static assumptions. In addition, we provide a prime order group analog of our first scheme and prove it secure in asymmetric bilinear groups. ∗Supported by National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship. †Supported by NSF CNS-0716199, CNS-0915361 and Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFO SR) under the MURI award for “Collaborative policies and assured information sharing” (Project PRESIDIO).",

Our IBE system has ciphertexts, private keys, and public parameters each consisting of a constant number of group elements. These results are the first HIBE system and the first IBE system with short parameters under simple assumptions. \n \nIn a Dual System Encryption system both ciphertexts and private keys can take on one of two indistinguishable forms.

These keys and ciphertexts will behave as one expects in an IBE system. In addition, we define semi-functional keys and ciphertexts. A semi-functional private key will be able to decrypt all normally generated ciphertexts; however, decryption will fail if one attempts to decrypt a semi-functional ciphertext with a semi-functional private key. Analogously, semi-functional ciphertexts will be decryptable only by normal private keys. \n \nDual System Encryption opens up a new way to prove security of IBE and related encryption systems. We define a sequence of games where we change first the challenge ciphertext and then the private keys one by one to be semi-functional.

The model can be instantiated into a family of Facebook-style social network systems, each with a recognizably different access control mechanism, so that Facebook is but one instantiation of the model.

These optimisations are analysed both theoretically and empirically, using experiments of various adversarial situations. Our experimental data is provided for reasonably large circuits, including one which performs an AES encryption, a problem which we discuss in the context of various possible applications.",

      "abstract": "Automatic recognition of human faces is becoming increasingly popular in civilian and law enforcement applications that require reliable recognition of humans. However, the rapid improvement and widespread deployment of this technology raises strong concerns regarding the violation of individuals' privacy. A typical application scenario for privacy-preserving face recognition concerns a client who privately searches for a specific face image in the face image database of a server. \n \nIn this paper we present a privacy-preserving face recognition scheme that substantially improves over previouswork in terms of communication-and computation efficiency: the most recent proposal of Erkin et al. (PETS'09) requires O(log M) rounds and computationally expensive operations on homomorphically encrypted data to recognize a face in a database of M faces. Our improved scheme requires only O(1) rounds and has a substantially smaller online communication complexity (by a factor of 15 for each database entry) and less computation complexity. \n \nOur solution is based on known cryptographic building blocks combining homomorphic encryption with garbled circuits. Our implementation results show the practicality of our scheme also for large databases (e.g., for M = 1000 we need less than 13 seconds and less than 4 MByte on-line communication on two 2.4GHz PCs connected via Gigabit Ethernet).",

      "abstract": "Cloud Computing has been envisioned as the next-generation architecture of IT Enterprise. It moves the application software and databases to the centralized large data centers, where the management of the data and services may not be fully trustworthy. This unique paradigm brings about many new security challenges, which have not been well understood. This work studies the problem of ensuring the integrity of data storage in Cloud Computing. In particular, we consider the task of allowing a third party auditor (TPA), on behalf of the cloud client, to verify the integrity of the dynamic data stored in the cloud. The introduction of TPA eliminates the involvement of client through the auditing of whether his data stored in the cloud is indeed intact, which can be important in achieving economies of scale for Cloud Computing. The support for data dynamics via the most general forms of data operation, such as block modification, insertion and deletion, is also a significant step toward practicality, since services in Cloud Computing are not limited to archive or backup data only. While prior works on ensuring remote data integrity often lacks the support of either public verifiability or dynamic data operations, this paper achieves both. We first identify the difficulties and potential security problems of direct extensions with fully dynamic data updates from prior works and then show how to construct an elegant verification scheme for seamless integration of these two salient features in our protocol design. In particular, to achieve efficient data dynamics, we improve the Proof of Retrievability model [1] by manipulating the classic Merkle Hash Tree (MHT) construction for block tag authentication. Extensive security and performance analysis show that the proposed scheme is highly efficient and provably secure.",

      "abstract": "Today, we have the ability to utilize scalable, distributed computing environments within the confines of the Internet, a practice known as cloud computing. In this new world of computing, users are universally required to accept the underlying premise of trust. Within the cloud computing world, the virtual environment lets users access computing power that exceeds that contained within their own physical worlds. Typically, users will know neither the exact location of their data nor the other sources of the data collectively stored with theirs. The data you can find in a cloud ranges from public source, which has minimal security concerns, to private data containing highly sensitive information (such as social security numbers, medical records, or shipping manifests for hazardous material). Does using a cloud environment alleviate the business entities of their responsibility to ensure that proper security measures are in place for both their data and applications, or do they share joint responsibility with service providers? The answers to this and other questions lie within the realm of yet-to-be-written law. As with most technological advances, regulators are typically in a \"catch-up\" mode to identify policy, governance, and law. Cloud computing presents an extension of problems heretofore experienced with the Internet. To ensure that such decisions are informed and appropriate for the cloud computing environment, the industry itself should establish coherent and effective policy and governance to identify and implement proper security methods.",

Here we demonstrate additional applications that enjoy strong security properties and a high level of efficiency. Namely, we construct: 1 Public-key and symmetric-key cryptosystems that provide security for key-dependent messages and enjoy circular security. Our schemes are highly efficient: in both cases the ciphertext is only a constant factor larger than the plaintext, and the cost of encryption and decryption is only n·polylog(n) bit operations per message symbol in the public-key case, and polylog(n) bit operations in the symmetric-case. \n1 Two efficient pseudorandom objects: a \"weak randomized pseudorandom function\" -- a relaxation of standard PRF -- that can be computed obliviously via a simple protocol, and a length-doubling pseudorandom generator that can be computed by a circuit of n ·polylog(n) size. The complexity of our pseudorandom generator almost matches the complexity of the fastest known construction (Applebaum et al., RANDOM 2006), which runs in linear time at the expense of relying on a nonstandard intractability assumption. \n \n \nOur constructions and security proofs are simple and natural, and involve new techniques that may be of independent interest.

      "abstract": "We propose a fully homomorphic encryption scheme -- i.e., a scheme that allows one to evaluate circuits over encrypted data without being able to decrypt. Our solution comes in three steps. First, we provide a general result -- that, to construct an encryption scheme that permits evaluation of arbitrary circuits, it suffices to construct an encryption scheme that can evaluate (slightly augmented versions of) its own decryption circuit; we call a scheme that can evaluate its (augmented) decryption circuit bootstrappable.\n Next, we describe a public key encryption scheme using ideal lattices that is almost bootstrappable.\n Lattice-based cryptosystems typically have decryption algorithms with low circuit complexity, often dominated by an inner product computation that is in NC1. Also, ideal lattices provide both additive and multiplicative homomorphisms (modulo a public-key ideal in a polynomial ring that is represented as a lattice), as needed to evaluate general circuits.\n Unfortunately, our initial scheme is not quite bootstrappable -- i.e., the depth that the scheme can correctly evaluate can be logarithmic in the lattice dimension, just like the depth of the decryption circuit, but the latter is greater than the former. In the final step, we show how to modify the scheme to reduce the depth of the decryption circuit, and thereby obtain a bootstrappable encryption scheme, without reducing the depth that the scheme can evaluate. Abstractly, we accomplish this by enabling the encrypter to start the decryption process, leaving less work for the decrypter, much like the server leaves less work for the decrypter in a server-aided cryptosystem.",

We define the relaxed notion of a semi-homomorphic encryption scheme, where the plaintext can be recovered as long as the computed function does not increase the size of the input \"too much\". We show that a number of existing cryptosystems are captured by our relaxed notion. In particular, we give examples of semi-homomorphic encryption schemes based on lattices, subset sum and factoring. We then demonstrate how semi-homomorphic encryption schemes allow us to construct an efficient multiparty computation protocol for arithmetic circuits, UC-secure against a dishonest majority. The protocol consists of a preprocessing phase and an online phase. Neither the inputs nor the function to be computed have to be known during preprocessing. Moreover, the online phase is extremely efficient as it requires no cryptographic operations: the parties only need to exchange additive shares and verify information theoretic MACs. Our contribution is therefore twofold: from a theoretical point of view, we can base multiparty computation on a variety of different assumptions, while on the practical side we offer a protocol with better efficiency than any previous solution.",

      "abstract": "We initiate the formal study of functional encryption by giving precise definitions of the concept and its security. Roughly speaking, functional encryption supports restricted secret keys that enable a key holder to learn a specific function of encrypted data, but learn nothing else about the data. For example, given an encrypted program the secret key may enable the key holder to learn the output of the program on a specific input without learning anything else about the program. \n \nWe show that defining security for functional encryption is non-trivial. First, we show that a natural game-based definition is inadequate for some functionalities. We then present a natural simulation-based definition and show that it (provably) cannot be satisfied in the standard model, but can be satisfied in the random oracle model. We show how to map many existing concepts to our formalization of functional encryption and conclude with several interesting open problems in this young area.",

We start by designing an efficient revocation scheme, based on secret sharing. It can remove up to t parties, is secure against coalitions of up to t users, and is more efficient than previous schemes with the same properties. We then show how to enhance the revocation scheme with traitor tracing and self-enforcement properties. More precisely, how to construct schemes such that (1) each user’s personal key contains some sensitive information of that user (e.g., the user’s credit card number), in order to make users reluctant to disclose their keys. (2) An illegal decryption device discloses the identity of users that contributed keys to construct the device. And, (3) it is possible to revoke the keys of corrupt users. For the last point, it is important to be able to do so without publicly disclosing the sensitive information.",

      "abstract": "With only the binary executable of a program, it is useful to discover the program's data structures and infer their syntactic and semantic definitions. Such knowledge is highly valuable in a variety of security and forensic applications. Although there exist efforts in program data structure inference, the existing solutions are not suitable for our targeted application scenarios. In this paper, we propose a reverse engineering technique to automatically reveal program data structures from binaries. Our technique, called REWARDS, is based on dynamic analysis. More specifically, each memory location accessed by the program is tagged with a timestamped type attribute. Following the program's runtime data flow, this attribute is propagated to other memory locations and registers that share the same type. During the propagation, a variable's type gets resolved if it is involved in a type-revealing execution point or type sink. More importantly, besides the forward type propagation, REWARDS involves a backward type resolution procedure where the types of some previously accessed variables get recursively resolved starting from a type sink. This procedure is constrained by the timestamps of relevant memory locations to disambiguate variables re-using the same memory location. In addition, REWARDS is able to reconstruct in-memory data structure layout based on the type information derived. We demonstrate that REWARDS provides unique benefits to two applications: memory image forensics and binary fuzzing for vulnerability discovery.",

      "abstract": "As Cloud Computing becomes prevalent, more and more sensitive information are being centralized into the cloud. For the protection of data privacy, sensitive data usually have to be encrypted before outsourcing, which makes effective data utilization a very challenging task. Although traditional searchable encryption schemes allow a user to securely search over encrypted data through keywords and selectively retrieve files of interest, these techniques support only exact keyword search. That is, there is no tolerance of minor typos and format inconsistencies which, on the other hand, are typical user searching behavior and happen very frequently. This significant drawback makes existing techniques unsuitable in Cloud Computing as it greatly affects system usability, rendering user searching experiences very frustrating and system efficacy very low. In this paper, for the first time we formalize and solve the problem of effective fuzzy keyword search over encrypted cloud data while maintaining keyword privacy. Fuzzy keyword search greatly enhances system usability by returning the matching files when users' searching inputs exactly match the predefined keywords or the closest possible matching files based on keyword similarity semantics, when exact match fails. In our solution, we exploit edit distance to quantify keywords similarity and develop an advanced technique on constructing fuzzy keyword sets, which greatly reduces the storage and representation overheads. Through rigorous security analysis, we show that our proposed solution is secure and privacy-preserving, while correctly realizing the goal of fuzzy keyword search.",

We formally define a hierarchy of natural classes of private cloud applications, and show that no cryptographic protocol can implement those classes where data is shared among clients.

      "abstract": "A number of works have investigated using tamper-proof hardware tokens as tools to achieve a variety of cryptographic tasks. In particular, Goldreich and Ostrovsky considered the problem of software protection via oblivious RAM. Goldwasser, Kalai, and Rothblum introduced the concept of one-time programs: in a one-time program, an honest sender sends a set of simple hardware tokens to a (potentially malicious) receiver. The hardware tokens allow the receiver to execute a secret program specified by the sender’s tokens exactly once (or, more generally, up to a fixed t times). A recent line of work initiated by Katz examined the problem of achieving UC-secure computation using hardware tokens. \n \nMotivated by the goal of unifying and strengthening these previous notions, we consider the general question of basing secure computation on hardware tokens. We show that the following tasks, which cannot be realized in the “plain” model, become feasible if the parties are allowed to generate and exchange tamper-proof hardware tokens. \n \nUnconditional and non-interactive secure computation. We show that by exchanging simple stateful hardware tokens, any functionality can be realized with unconditional security against malicious parties. In the case of two-party functionalities f(x,y) which take their inputs from a sender and a receiver and deliver their output to the receiver, our protocol is non-interactive and only requires a unidirectional communication of simple stateful tokens from the sender to the receiver. This strengthens previous feasibility results for one-time programs both by providing unconditional security and by offering general protection against malicious senders. As is typically the case for unconditionally secure protocols, our protocol is in fact UC-secure. This improves over previous works on UC-secure computation based on hardware tokens, which provided computational security under cryptographic assumptions. \n \nInteractive secure computation from stateless tokens based on one-way functions. We show that stateless hardware tokens are sufficient to base general secure (in fact, UC-secure) computation on the existence of one-way functions. \n \nObfuscation from stateless tokens. We consider the problem of realizing non-interactive secure computation from stateless tokens for functionalities which allow the receiver to provide an arbitrary number of inputs (these are the only functionalities one can hope to realize non-interactively with stateless tokens). By building on recent techniques for resettably secure computation, we obtain a general positive result under standard cryptographic assumptions. This gives the first general feasibility result for program obfuscation using stateless tokens, while strengthening the standard notion of obfuscation by providing security against a malicious sender.",

      "abstract": "Following Gennaro, Gentry, and Parno (Cryptology ePrint Archive 2009/547), we use fully homomorphic encryption to design improved schemes for delegating computation. In such schemes, a delegator outsources the computation of a function F on many, dynamically chosen inputs xi to a worker in such a way that it is infeasible for the worker to make the delegator accept a result other than F(xi). The \"online stage\" of the Gennaro et al. scheme is very efficient: the parties exchange two messages, the delegator runs in time poly(log T), and the worker runs in time poly(T), where T is the time complexity of F. However, the \"offline stage\" (which depends on the function F but not the inputs to be delegated) is inefficient: the delegator runs in time poly(T) and generates a public key of length poly(T) that needs to be accessed by the worker during the online stage. \n \nOur first construction eliminates the large public key from the Gennaro et al. scheme. The delegator still invests poly(T) time in the offline stage, but does not need to communicate or publish anything. Our second construction reduces the work of the delegator in the offline stage to poly(log T) at the price of a 4-message (offline) interaction with a poly(T)-time worker (which need not be the same as the workers used in the online stage). Finally, we describe a \"pipelined\" implementation of the second construction that avoids the need to re-run the offline construction after errors are detected (assuming errors are not too frequent).",

However, the fact that users no longer have physical possession of the possibly large size of outsourced data makes the data integrity protection in Cloud Computing a very challenging and potentially formidable task, especially for users with constrained computing resources and capabilities. Thus, enabling public auditability for cloud data storage security is of critical importance so that users can resort to an external audit party to check the integrity of outsourced data when needed. To securely introduce an effective third party auditor (TPA), the following two fundamental requirements have to be met: 1) TPA should be able to efficiently audit the cloud data storage without demanding the local copy of data, and introduce no additional on-line burden to the cloud user; 2) The third party auditing process should bring in no new vulnerabilities towards user data privacy. In this paper, we utilize and uniquely combine the public key based homomorphic authenticator with random masking to achieve the privacy-preserving public cloud data auditing system, which meets all above requirements. To support efficient handling of multiple auditing tasks, we further explore the technique of bilinear aggregate signature to extend our main result into a multi-user setting, where TPA can perform multiple auditing tasks simultaneously. Extensive security and performance analysis shows the proposed schemes are provably secure and highly efficient.",

      "abstract": "Secure two-party computation allows two untrusting parties to jointly compute an arbitrary function on their respective private inputs while revealing no information beyond the outcome. Existing cryptographic compilers can automatically generate secure computation protocols from high-level specifications, but are often limited in their use and efficiency of generated protocols as they are based on either garbled circuits or (additively) homomorphic encryption only.\n In this paper we present TASTY, a novel tool for automating, i.e., describing, generating, executing, benchmarking, and comparing, efficient secure two-party computation protocols. TASTY is a new compiler that can generate protocols based on homomorphic encryption and efficient garbled circuits as well as combinations of both, which often yields the most efficient protocols available today. The user provides a high-level description of the computations to be performed on encrypted data in a domain-specific language. This is automatically transformed into a protocol. TASTY provides most recent techniques and optimizations for practical secure two-party computation with low online latency. Moreover, it allows to efficiently evaluate circuits generated by the well-known Fairplay compiler.\n We use TASTY to compare protocols for secure multiplication based on homomorphic encryption with those based on garbled circuits and highly efficient Karatsuba multiplication. Further, we show how TASTY improves the online latency for securely evaluating the AES functionality by an order of magnitude compared to previous software implementations. TASTY allows to automatically generate efficient secure protocols for many privacy-preserving applications where we consider the use cases for private set intersection and face recognition protocols.",

Smart and Vercauteren implemented the underlying \"somewhat homomorphic\" scheme, but were not able to implement the bootstrapping functionality that is needed to get the complete scheme to work. We show a number of optimizations that allow us to implement all aspects of the scheme, including the bootstrapping functionality. \n \nOur main optimization is a key-generation method for the underlying somewhat homomorphic encryption, that does not require full polynomial inversion. This reduces the asymptotic complexity from O(n2.5) to O(n1.5) when working with dimension-n lattices (and practically reducing the time from many hours/days to a few seconds/minutes). Other optimizations include a batching technique for encryption, a careful analysis of the degree of the decryption polynomial, and some space/time trade-offs for the fully-homomorphic scheme. \n \nWe tested our implementation with lattices of several dimensions, corresponding to several security levels. From a \"toy\" setting in dimension 512, to \"small,\" \"medium,\" and \"large\" settings in dimensions 2048, 8192, and 32768, respectively.

We give a method with O(log n) amortized access overhead for simulating a RAM algorithm that has a memory of size n, using a scheme that is data-oblivious with very high probability. We assume that the simulation has access to a private workspace of size O(nv), for any given fixed constant v > 0, but does not maintain state in between data access requests. Our simulation makes use of pseudorandom hash functions and is based on a novel hierarchy of cuckoo hash tables that all share a common stash. The method outperforms all previous techniques for stateless clients in terms of access overhead. We also provide experimental results from a prototype implementation of our scheme, showing its practicality. In addition, we show that one can eliminate the dependence on pseudorandom hash functions in our simulation while having the overhead rise to be O(log2 n).",

      "abstract": "The prospect of outsourcing an increasing amount of data storage and management to cloud services raises many new privacy concerns for individuals and businesses alike. The privacy concerns can be satisfactorily addressed if users encrypt the data they send to the cloud. If the encryption scheme is homomorphic, the cloud can still perform meaningful computations on the data, even though it is encrypted.\n In fact, we now know a number of constructions of fully homomorphic encryption schemes that allow arbitrary computation on encrypted data. In the last two years, solutions for fully homomorphic encryption have been proposed and improved upon, but it is hard to ignore the elephant in the room, namely efficiency -- can homomorphic encryption ever be efficient enough to be practical? Certainly, it seems that all known fully homomorphic encryption schemes have a long way to go before they can be used in practice. Given this state of affairs, our contribution is two-fold.\n First, we exhibit a number of real-world applications, in the medical, financial, and the advertising domains, which require only that the encryption scheme is \"somewhat\" homomorphic. Somewhat homomorphic encryption schemes, which support a limited number of homomorphic operations, can be much faster, and more compact than fully homomorphic encryption schemes.\n Secondly, we show a proof-of-concept implementation of the recent somewhat homomorphic encryption scheme of Brakerski and Vaikuntanathan, whose security relies on the \"ring learning with errors\" (Ring LWE) problem. The scheme is very efficient, and has reasonably short ciphertexts. Our unoptimized implementation in magma enjoys comparable efficiency to even optimized pairing-based schemes with the same level of security and homomorphic capacity. We also show a number of application-specific optimizations to the encryption scheme, most notably the ability to convert between different message encodings in a ciphertext.",

      "abstract": "We present a radically new approach to fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) that dramatically improves performance and bases security on weaker assumptions. A central conceptual contribution in our work is a new way of constructing leveled fully homomorphic encryption schemes (capable of evaluating arbitrary polynomial-size circuits), without Gentry’s bootstrapping procedure. Specifically, we offer a choice of FHE schemes based on the learning with error (LWE) or ring-LWE (RLWE) problems that have 2 security against known attacks. For RLWE, we have: • A leveled FHE scheme that can evaluate L-level arithmetic circuits with O(λ · L) per-gate computation – i.e., computation quasi-linear in the security parameter. Security is based on RLWE for an approximation factor exponential in L. This construction does not use the bootstrapping procedure. • A leveled FHE scheme that uses bootstrapping as an optimization, where the per-gate computation (which includes the bootstrapping procedure) is O(λ), independent of L. Security is based on the hardness of RLWE for quasi-polynomial factors (as opposed to the sub-exponential factors needed in previous schemes). We obtain similar results for LWE, but with worse performance. We introduce a number of further optimizations to our schemes. As an example, for circuits of large width – e.g., where a constant fraction of levels have width at least λ – we can reduce the per-gate computation of the bootstrapped version to O(λ), independent of L, by batching the bootstrapping operation. Previous FHE schemes all required Ω(λ) computation per gate. At the core of our construction is a much more effective approach for managing the noise level of lattice-based ciphertexts as homomorphic operations are performed, using some new techniques recently introduced by Brakerski and Vaikuntanathan (FOCS 2011). ∗Sponsored by the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL).

      "abstract": "We further the study of order-preserving symmetric encryption (OPE), a primitive for allowing efficient range queries on encrypted data, recently initiated (from a cryptographic perspective) by Boldyreva et al. (Eurocrypt'09). First, we address the open problem of characterizing what encryption via a random order-preserving function (ROPF) leaks about underlying data (ROPF being the \"ideal object\" in the security definition, POPF, satisfied by their scheme.) In particular, we show that, for a database of randomly distributed plaintexts and appropriate choice of parameters, ROPF encryption leaks neither the precise value of any plaintext nor the precise distance between any two of them. The analysis here is quite technically non-trivial and introduces useful new techniques. On the other hand, we also show that ROPF encryption does leak both the value of any plaintext as well as the distance between any two plaintexts to within a range of possibilities roughly the square root of the domain size. We then study schemes that are not order-preserving, but which nevertheless allow efficient range queries and achieve security notions stronger than POPF. In a setting where the entire database is known in advance of key-generation (considered in several prior works), we show that recent constructions of \"monotone minimal perfect hash functions\" allow to efficiently achieve (an adaptation of) the notion of IND-O(rdered) CPA also considered by Boldyreva et al., which asks that only the order relations among the plaintexts is leaked. Finally, we introduce modular order-preserving encryption (MOPE), in which the scheme of Boldyreva et al. is prepended with a shift cipher. MOPE improves the security of OPE in a sense, as it does not leak any information about plaintext location. We clarify that our work should not be interpreted as saying the original scheme of Boldyreva et al., or the variants that we introduce, are \"secure\" or \"insecure.\" Rather, the goal of this line of research is to help practitioners decide whether the options provide a suitable security-functionality tradeoff for a given application.",

Our solution focuses on the following two research directions: First, we present a novel Privacy Preserving Cipher Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (PP-CP-ABE) to protect sensing data. Using PP-CP-ABE, light-weight devices can securely outsource heavy encryption and decryption operations to cloud service providers, without revealing the data content. Second, we propose an Attribute Based Data Storage (ABDS) system as a cryptographic group-based access control mechanism.

However, outsourcing computation is useful only when the returned result can be trusted, which makes verifiable computation (VC) a must for such scenarios. \n \nIn this work we extend the definition of verifiable computation in two important directions: public delegation and public verifiability, which have important applications in many practical delegation scenarios. Yet, existing VC constructions based on standard cryptographic assumptions fail to achieve these properties. \n \nAs the primary contribution of our work, we establish an important (and somewhat surprising) connection between verifiable computation and attribute-based encryption (ABE), a primitive that has been widely studied. Namely, we show how to construct a VC scheme with public delegation and public verifiability from any ABE scheme. The VC scheme verifies any function in the class of functions covered by the permissible ABE policies (currently Boolean formulas). This scheme enjoys a very efficient verification algorithm that depends only on the output size. Efficient delegation, however, requires the ABE encryption algorithm to be cheaper than the original function computation. Strengthening this connection, we show a construction of a multi-function verifiable computation scheme from an ABE scheme with outsourced decryption, a primitive defined recently by Green, Hohenberger and Waters (USENIX Security 2011). A multi-function VC scheme allows the verifiable evaluation of multiple functions on the same preprocessed input. \n \nIn the other direction, we also explore the construction of an ABE scheme from verifiable computation protocols.",

      "abstract": "All previously known fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) schemes use Gentry's blueprint:* SWHE: Construct a somewhat homomorphic encryption (SWHE) scheme -- roughly, an encryption scheme that can homomorphically evaluate polynomials up to some degree.* Squash: ``Squash\" the decryption function of the SWHE scheme, so that the scheme can evaluate functions twice as complex (in terms of polynomial degree) than its own decryption function. Do this by adding a ``hint \" to the SHWE public key -- namely, a large set of vectors that has a secret sparse subset that sums to the original secret key.* Bootstrap: Given a SWHE scheme that can evaluate functions twice as complex as its decryption function, apply Gentry's transformation to get a ``leveled\" FHE scheme. To get ``pure\" (non-leveled) FHE, one assumes circular security. Here, we describe a new blueprint for FHE. We show how to eliminate the squashing step, and thereby eliminate the need to assume that the sparse subset sum problem (SSSP) is hard, as all previous leveled FHE schemes have done. Using our new blueprint, we obtain the following results:* A ``simple\" leveled FHE scheme where we replace SSSP with Decision Diffie-Hellman!* The first leveled FHE scheme based entirely on worst-case hardness}. Specifically, we give a leveled FHE scheme with security based on the shortest independent vector problem over ideal lattices (ideal-SIVP).* Some efficiency improvements for FHE.} While the new blueprint does not yet improve computational efficiency, it reduces cipher text length. As in the previous blueprint, we obtain pure FHE by assuming circular security. Our main technique is to express the decryption function of SWHE schemes as a depth-3 ($\\sum \\prod \\sum$) arithmetic circuit. When we evaluate this decryption function homomorphically, we temporarily switch to a multiplicatively homomorphic encryption (MHE) scheme, such as Elgamal, to handle the $\\prod$ part, after which we translate the result from the MHE scheme back to the SWHE scheme by evaluating the MHE scheme's decryption function within the SWHE scheme. The SWHE scheme only needs to be able to evaluate the MHE scheme's decryption function (plus minor operations), and does not need to have the self-referential property of being able to evaluate its {\\em own} decryption function, a property that necessitated squashing in the original blueprint.",

For all known somewhat homomorphic encryption schemes, this requirement was not known to be achievable under any cryptographic assumption, and had to be explicitly assumed. We take a step forward towards removing this additional assumption by proving that our scheme is in fact secure when encrypting polynomial functions of the secret key. \n \nOur scheme is based on the ring learning with errors (RLWE) assumption that was recently introduced by Lyubashevsky, Peikert and Regev (Eurocrypt 2010).

The online phase is unconditionally secure and has total computational and communication complexity linear in n, the number of players, where earlier work was quadratic in n. Moreover, the work done by each player is only a small constant factor larger than what one would need to compute the circuit in the clear. We show this is optimal for computation in large fields. In practice, for 3 players, a secure 64-bit multiplication can be done in 0.05 ms. Our preprocessing is based on a somewhat homomorphic cryptosystem. We extend a scheme by Brakerski et al., so that we can perform distributed decryption and handle many values in parallel in one ciphertext. The computational complexity of our preprocessing phase is dominated by the public-key operations, we need $$On^2/s$$ operations per secure multiplication where s is a parameter that increases with the security parameter of the cryptosystem. Earlier work in this model needed $$\\varOmega n^2$$ operations. In practice, the preprocessing prepares a secure 64-bit multiplication for 3 players in about 13 ms.",

Other than CS proofs in the random oracle model [Micali, FOCS '94], the only existing candidate construction is based on an elaborate assumption that is tailored to a specific protocol [Di Crescenzo and Lipmaa, CiE '08].\n We formulate a general and relatively natural notion of an extractable collision-resistant hash function (ECRH) and show that, if ECRHs exist, then a modified version of Di Crescenzo and Lipmaa's protocol is a succinct non-interactive argument for NP. Furthermore, the modified protocol is actually a succinct non-interactive adaptive argument of knowledge (SNARK). We then propose several candidate constructions for ECRHs and relaxations thereof.\n We demonstrate the applicability of SNARKs to various forms of delegation of computation, to succinct non-interactive zero knowledge arguments, and to succinct two-party secure computation. Finally, we show that SNARKs essentially imply the existence of ECRHs, thus demonstrating the necessity of the assumption.",

      "abstract": "We propose a new notion of secure multiparty computation aided by a computationally-powerful but untrusted \"cloud\" server. In this notion that we call on-the-fly multiparty computation (MPC), the cloud can non-interactively perform arbitrary, dynamically chosen computations on data belonging to arbitrary sets of users chosen on-the-fly. All user's input data and intermediate results are protected from snooping by the cloud as well as other users. This extends the standard notion of fully homomorphic encryption (FHE), where users can only enlist the cloud's help in evaluating functions on their own encrypted data.\n In on-the-fly MPC, each user is involved only when initially uploading his (encrypted) data to the cloud, and in a final output decryption phase when outputs are revealed; the complexity of both is independent of the function being computed and the total number of users in the system. When users upload their data, they need not decide in advance which function will be computed, nor who they will compute with; they need only retroactively approve the eventually-chosen functions and on whose data the functions were evaluated.\n This notion is qualitatively the best possible in minimizing interaction, since the users' interaction in the decryption stage is inevitable: we show that removing it would imply generic program obfuscation and is thus impossible.\n Our contributions are two-fold:- We show how on-the-fly MPC can be achieved using a new type of encryption scheme that we call multikey FHE, which is capable of operating on inputs encrypted under multiple, unrelated keys. A ciphertext resulting from a multikey evaluation can be jointly decrypted using the secret keys of all the users involved in the computation. - We construct a multikey FHE scheme based on NTRU, a very efficient public-key encryption scheme proposed in the 1990s. It was previously not known how to make NTRU fully homomorphic even for a single party. We view the construction of (multikey) FHE from NTRU encryption as a main contribution of independent interest. Although the transformation to a fully homomorphic system deteriorates the efficiency of NTRU somewhat, we believe that this system is a leading candidate for a practical FHE scheme.",

Using SIMD techniques, we can process over 54 blocks in each evaluation, yielding an amortized rate of just under 40 minutes per block. Another implementation takes just over two and a half days to evaluate the AES operation, but can process 720 blocks in each evaluation, yielding an amortized rate of just over five minutes per block.

This paper explores the validity of that belief. We develop three classes of protocols targeted to different set sizes and domains, all based on Yao’s generic garbled-circuit method. We then compare the performance of our protocols to the fastest custom PSI protocols in the literature. Our results show that a careful application of garbled circuits leads to solutions that can run on million-element sets on typical desktops, and that can be competitive with the fastest custom protocols. Moreover, generic protocols like ours can be used directly for performing more complex secure computations, something we demonstrate by adding a simple information-auditing mechanism to our PSI protocols.",

The most immediate application of SSE is to cloud storage, where it enables a client to securely outsource its data to an untrusted cloud provider without sacrificing the ability to search over it.\n SSE has been the focus of active research and a multitude of schemes that achieve various levels of security and efficiency have been proposed. Any practical SSE scheme, however, should (at a minimum) satisfy the following properties: sublinear search time, security against adaptive chosen-keyword attacks, compact indexes and the ability to add and delete files efficiently. Unfortunately, none of the previously-known SSE constructions achieve all these properties at the same time. This severely limits the practical value of SSE and decreases its chance of deployment in real-world cloud storage systems.\n To address this, we propose the first SSE scheme to satisfy all the properties outlined above. Our construction extends the inverted index approach (Curtmola et al., CCS 2006) in several non-trivial ways and introduces new techniques for the design of SSE. In addition, we implement our scheme and conduct a performance evaluation, showing that our approach is highly efficient and ready for deployment.",

      "abstract": "Succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge (SNARKs) enable verifying NP statements with complexity that is essentially independent of that required for classical NP verification. In particular, they provide strong solutions to the problem of verifiably delegating computation. We construct the first fully-succinct publicly-verifiable SNARK. To do that, we first show how to \"bootstrap\" any SNARK that requires expensive preprocessing to obtain a SNARK that does not, while preserving public verifiability. We then apply this transformation to known SNARKs with preprocessing. Moreover, the SNARK we construct only requires of the prover time and space that are essentially the same as that required for classical NP verification. Our transformation assumes only collision-resistant hashing; curiously, it does not rely on PCPs. We also show an analogous transformation for privately-verifiable SNARKs, assuming fully-homomorphic encryption.\n At the heart of our transformations is a technique for recursive composition of SNARKs. This technique uses in an essential way the proof-carrying data (PCD) framework, which extends SNARKs to the setting of distributed networks of provers and verifiers. Concretely, to bootstrap a given SNARK, we recursively compose the SNARK to obtain a \"weak\" PCD system for shallow distributed computations, and then use the PCD framework to attain stronger notions of SNARKs and PCD systems.",

We show that by incorporating the best known techniques and parallelizing almost all steps of the resulting protocol, evaluating billion-gate circuits is feasible in the malicious model.

Obfuscators, if they exist, would have a wide variety of cryptographic and complexity-theoretic applications, ranging from software protection to homomorphic encryption to complexity-theoretic analogues of Rice's theorem. Most of these applications are based on an interpretation of the “unintelligibility” condition in obfuscation as meaning that <i>O</i>(<i>P</i>) is a “virtual black box,” in the sense that anything one can efficiently compute given <i>O</i>(<i>P</i>), one could also efficiently compute given oracle access to <i>P</i>.\n In this work, we initiate a theoretical investigation of obfuscation. Our main result is that, even under very weak formalizations of the above intuition, obfuscation is impossible. We prove this by constructing a family of efficient programs <i>P</i> that are <i>unobfuscatable</i> in the sense that (a) given <i>any</i> efficient program <i>P</i>' that computes the same function as a program <i>P</i> ∈ <i>p</i>, the “source code” <i>P</i> can be efficiently reconstructed, yet (b) given <i>oracle access</i> to a (randomly selected) program <i>P</i> ∈ <i>p</i>, no efficient algorithm can reconstruct <i>P</i> (or even distinguish a certain bit in the code from random) except with negligible probability.\n We extend our impossibility result in a number of ways, including even obfuscators that (a) are not necessarily computable in polynomial time, (b) only approximately preserve the functionality, and (c) only need to work for very restricted models of computation (<b>TC<sup>0</sup></b>). We also rule out several potential applications of obfuscators, by constructing “unobfuscatable” signature schemes, encryption schemes, and pseudorandom function families.",

Specifically, we give a mechanism that privately releases synthetic data useful for answering a class of queries over a discrete domain with error that grows as a function of the size of the smallest net approximately representing the answers to that class of queries. We show that this in particular implies a mechanism for counting queries that gives error guarantees that grow only with the VC-dimension of the class of queries, which itself grows at most logarithmically with the size of the query class.\n We also show that it is not possible to release even simple classes of queries (such as intervals and their generalizations) over continuous domains with worst-case utility guarantees while preserving differential privacy. In response to this, we consider a relaxation of the utility guarantee and give a privacy preserving polynomial time algorithm that for any halfspace query will provide an answer that is accurate for some small perturbation of the query. This algorithm does not release synthetic data, but instead another data structure capable of representing an answer for each query. We also give an efficient algorithm for releasing synthetic data for the class of interval queries and axis-aligned rectangles of constant dimension over discrete domains.",

      "abstract": "Large scale data processing brings new challenges to the design of privacy-preserving protocols: how to meet the increasing requirements of speed and throughput of modern applications, and how to scale up smoothly when data being protected is big. Efficiency and scalability become critical criteria for privacy preserving protocols in the age of Big Data. In this paper, we present a new Private Set Intersection (PSI) protocol that is extremely efficient and highly scalable compared with existing protocols. The protocol is based on a novel approach that we call oblivious Bloom intersection. It has linear complexity and relies mostly on efficient symmetric key operations. It has high scalability due to the fact that most operations can be parallelized easily. The protocol has two versions: a basic protocol and an enhanced protocol, the security of the two variants is analyzed and proved in the semi-honest model and the malicious model respectively. A prototype of the basic protocol has been built. We report the result of performance evaluation and compare it against the two previously fastest PSI protocols. Our protocol is orders of magnitude faster than these two protocols. To compute the intersection of two million-element sets, our protocol needs only 41 seconds (80-bit security) and 339 seconds (256-bit security) on moderate hardware in parallel mode.",

      "abstract": "Order-preserving encryption - an encryption scheme where the sort order of ciphertexts matches the sort order of the corresponding plaintexts - allows databases and other applications to process queries involving order over encrypted data efficiently. The ideal security guarantee for order-preserving encryption put forth in the literature is for the ciphertexts to reveal no information about the plaintexts besides order. Even though more than a dozen schemes were proposed, all these schemes leak more information than order. This paper presents the first order-preserving scheme that achieves ideal security. Our main technique is mutable ciphertexts, meaning that over time, the ciphertexts for a small number of plaintext values change, and we prove that mutable ciphertexts are needed for ideal security. Our resulting protocol is interactive, with a small number of interactions. We implemented our scheme and evaluated it on microbenchmarks and in the context of an encrypted MySQL database application. We show that in addition to providing ideal security, our scheme achieves 1 - 2 orders of magnitude higher performance than the state-of-the-art order-preserving encryption scheme, which is less secure than our scheme.",

As a special case, this implies the ability to generate keys for predicates P, which allow one to sign any message m for which Pm=1. \n \nWe show applications of functional signatures to constructing succinct non-interactive arguments and delegation schemes.

      "abstract": "Bit coin is a decentralized digital currency, introduced in 2008, that has recently gained noticeable popularity. Its main features are: (a) it lacks a central authority that controls the transactions, (b) the list of transactions is publicly available, and (c) its syntax allows more advanced transactions than simply transferring the money. The goal of this paper is to show how these properties of Bit coin can be used in the area of secure multiparty computation protocols (MPCs). Firstly, we show that the Bit coin system provides an attractive way to construct a version of \"timed commitments\", where the committer has to reveal his secret within a certain time frame, or to pay a fine. This, in turn, can be used to obtain fairness in some multiparty protocols. Secondly, we introduce a concept of multiparty protocols that work \"directly on Bit coin\". Recall that the standard definition of the MPCs guarantees only that the protocol \"emulates the trusted third party\". Hence ensuring that the inputs are correct, and the outcome is respected is beyond the scope of the definition. Our observation is that the Bit coin system can be used to go beyond the standard \"emulation-based\" definition, by constructing protocols that link their inputs and the outputs with the real Bit coin transactions. As an instantiation of this idea we construct protocols for secure multiparty lotteries using the Bit coin currency, without relying on a trusted authority (one of these protocols uses the Bit coin-based timed commitments mentioned above). Our protocols guarantee fairness for the honest parties no matter how the loser behaves. For example: if one party interrupts the protocol then her money is transferred to the honest participants. Our protocols are practical (to demonstrate it we performed their transactions in the actual Bit coin system), and can be used in real life as a replacement for the online gambling sites. We think that this paradigm can have also other applications. We discuss some of them.",

We also describe a different technique for proving the full randomization of encodings: instead of Gaussian linear sums, we apply the classical leftover hash lemma over a quotient lattice. We show that our construction is relatively practical: for reasonable security parameters a one-round 7-party Diffie-Hellman key exchange requires less than 40 seconds per party.

One of the primary techniques for achieving efficient secure two-party computation is that of Yao’s garbled circuits (FOCS 1986). In the semi-honest model, where just one garbled circuit is constructed and evaluated, Yao’s protocol has proven itself to be very efficient. However, a malicious adversary who constructs the garbled circuit may construct a garbling of a different circuit computing a different function, and this cannot be detected (due to the garbling). In order to solve this problem, many circuits are sent and some of them are opened to check that they are correct while the others are evaluated. This methodology, called cut-and-choose, introduces significant overhead, both in computation and in communication, and is mainly due to the number of circuits that must be used in order to prevent cheating.",

In 2012, Lopez-Alt, Tromer and Vaikuntanathan proposed a fully homomorphic scheme based on this modified system. However, to allow homomorphic operations and prove security, a non-standard assumption is required. In this paper, we show how to remove this non-standard assumption via techniques introduced by Brakerski and construct a new fully homomorphic encryption scheme from the Stehle and Steinfeld version based on standard lattice assumptions and a circular security assumption. The scheme is scale-invariant and therefore avoids modulus switching and the size of ciphertexts is one ring element. Moreover, we present a practical variant of our scheme, which is secure under stronger assumptions, along with parameter recommendations and promising implementation results. Finally, we present an approach for encrypting larger input sizes by extending ciphertexts to several ring elements via the CRT on the message space.",

Garbled circuits found numerous applications, but every known construction suffers from one limitation: it offers no security if used on multiple inputs x. In this paper, we construct for the first time  reusable garbled circuits. The key building block is a new succinct single-key functional encryption scheme.\n Functional encryption is an ambitious primitive: given an encryption Enc(x) of a value x, and a secret key sk_f for a function f, anyone can compute f(x) without learning any other information about x. We construct, for the first time, a succinct functional encryption scheme for {\\em any} polynomial-time function f where succinctness means that the ciphertext size does not grow with the size of the circuit for f, but only with its depth. The security of our construction is based on the intractability of the Learning with Errors (LWE) problem and holds as long as an adversary has access to a single key sk_f (or even an a priori bounded number of keys for different functions).\n Building on our succinct single-key functional encryption scheme, we show several new applications in addition to reusable garbled circuits, such as a paradigm for general function obfuscation which we call token-based obfuscation, homomorphic encryption for a class of Turing machines where the evaluation runs in input-specific time rather than worst-case time, and a scheme for delegating computation which is publicly verifiable and maintains the privacy of the computation.",

We resolve this question by giving the first construction of deniable encryption that does not require any pre-planning by the party that must later issue a denial.\n In addition, we show the generality of our punctured programs technique by also constructing a variety of core cryptographic objects from indistinguishability obfuscation and one-way functions (or close variants). In particular we obtain: public key encryption, short \"hash-and-sign\" selectively secure signatures, chosen-ciphertext secure public key encryption, non-interactive zero knowledge proofs (NIZKs), injective trapdoor functions, and oblivious transfer.

Just Garble evaluates moderate-sized garbled-circuits at an amortized cost of 23.2 cycles per gate (7.25 nsec), far faster than any prior reported results.",

      "abstract": "Cloud storage service providers such as Dropbox, Mozy, and others perform deduplication to save space by only storing one copy of each file uploaded. Should clients conventionally encrypt their files, however, savings are lost. Message-locked encryption (the most prominent manifestation of which is convergent encryption) resolves this tension. However it is inherently subject to brute-force attacks that can recover files falling into a known set. We propose an architecture that provides secure deduplicated storage resisting brute-force attacks, and realize it in a system called DupLESS. In DupLESS, clients encrypt under message-based keys obtained from a key-server via an oblivious PRF protocol. It enables clients to store encrypted data with an existing service, have the service perform deduplication on their behalf, and yet achieves strong confidentiality guarantees. We show that encryption for deduplicated storage can achieve performance and space savings close to that of using the storage service with plaintext data.",

In this work, we construct three major classification protocols that satisfy this privacy constraint: hyperplane decision, Naïve Bayes, and decision trees. We also enable these protocols to be combined with AdaBoost. At the basis of these constructions is a new library of building blocks, which enables constructing a wide range of privacy-preserving classifiers; we demonstrate how this library can be used to construct other classifiers than the three mentioned above, such as a multiplexer and a face detection classifier.

      "abstract": "Increasingly, confidential medical records are being stored in data centers hosted by hospitals or large companies. As sophisticated algorithms for predictive analysis on medical data continue to be developed, it is likely that, in the future, more and more computation will be done on private patient data. While encryption provides a tool for assuring the privacy of medical information, it limits the functionality for operating on such data. Conventional encryption methods used today provide only very restricted possibilities or none at all to operate on encrypted data without decrypting it first. Homomorphic encryption provides a tool for handling such computations on encrypted data, without decrypting the data, and without even needing the decryption key. In this paper, we discuss possible application scenarios for homomorphic encryption in order to ensure privacy of sensitive medical data. We describe how to privately conduct predictive analysis tasks on encrypted data using homomorphic encryption. As a proof of concept, we present a working implementation of a prediction service running in the cloud (hosted on Microsoft's Windows Azure), which takes as input private encrypted health data, and returns the probability for suffering cardiovascular disease in encrypted form. Since the cloud service uses homomorphic encryption, it makes this prediction while handling only encrypted data, learning nothing about the submitted confidential medical data.",

      "abstract": "The well-known classical constructions of garbled circuits use four ciphertexts per gate, although various methods have been proposed to reduce this cost. The best previously known methods for optimizing AND gates (two ciphertexts; Pinkas et al., ASIACRYPT 2009) and XOR gates (zero ciphertexts; Kolesnikov and Schneider, ICALP 2008) were incompatible, so most implementations used the best known method compatible with free-XOR gates (three ciphertexts; Kolesnikov and Schneider, ICALP 2008). In this work we show how to simultaneously garble AND gates using two ciphertexts and XOR gates using zero ciphertexts, resulting in smaller garbled circuits than any prior scheme. The main idea behind our construction is to break an AND gate into two half-gates — AND gates for which one party knows one input. Each half-gate can be garbled with a single ciphertext, so our construction uses two ciphertexts for each AND gate while being compatible with free-XOR gates. The price for the reduction in size is that the evaluator must perform two cryptographic operations per AND gate, rather than one as in previous schemes. We experimentally demonstrate that our garbling scheme leads to an overall decrease in time (up to 25%), bandwidth (up to 33%), and energy use (up to 20%) over several benchmark applications. We show that our construction is optimal for a large class of garbling schemes encompassing all known practical garbling techniques.",

Yet, it still reveals payments' destinations and amounts, and is limited in functionality. In this paper, we construct a full-fledged ledger-based digital currency with strong privacy guarantees. Our results leverage recent advances in zero-knowledge Succinct Non-interactive Arguments of Knowledge (zk-SNARKs). First, we formulate and construct decentralized anonymous payment schemes (DAP schemes). A DAP scheme enables users to directly pay each other privately: the corresponding transaction hides the payment's origin, destination, and transferred amount. We provide formal definitions and proofs of the construction's security. Second, we build Zero cash, a practical instantiation of our DAP scheme construction.

Since then a growing literature has identified hidden-but-important properties of the system, discovered attacks, proposed promising alternatives, and singled out difficult future challenges. Meanwhile a large and vibrant open-source community has proposed and deployed numerous modifications and extensions. We provide the first systematic exposition Bit coin and the many related crypto currencies or 'altcoins.' Drawing from a scattered body of knowledge, we identify three key components of Bit coin's design that can be decoupled. This enables a more insightful analysis of Bit coin's properties and future stability. We map the design space for numerous proposed modifications, providing comparative analyses for alternative consensus mechanisms, currency allocation mechanisms, computational puzzles, and key management tools. We survey anonymity issues in Bit coin and provide an evaluation framework for analyzing a variety of privacy-enhancing proposals.

We present Hawk, a decentralized smart contract system that does not store financial transactions in the clear on the blockchain, thus retaining transactional privacy from the public's view. A Hawk programmer can write a private smart contract in an intuitive manner without having to implement cryptography, and our compiler automatically generates an efficient cryptographic protocol where contractual parties interact with the blockchain, using cryptographic primitives such as zero-knowledge proofs. To formally define and reason about the security of our protocols, we are the first to formalize the blockchain model of cryptography. The formal modeling is of independent interest.

      "abstract": "In this work we study interactive proofs for tractable languages. The (honest) prover should be efficient and run in polynomial time or, in other words, a “muggle”.1 The verifier should be super-efficient and run in nearly linear time. These proof systems can be used for delegating computation: a server can run a computation for a client and interactively prove the correctness of the result. The client can verify the result’s correctness in nearly linear time (instead of running the entire computation itself).\n Previously, related questions were considered in the holographic proof setting by Babai et al. [1991b] in the argument setting under computational assumptions by Kilian, and in the random oracle model by Micali [1994]. Our focus, however, is on the original interactive proof model where no assumptions are made on the computational power or adaptiveness of dishonest provers.\n Our main technical theorem gives a public coin interactive proof for any language computable by a log-space uniform boolean circuit with depth d and input length n. The verifier runs in time n · poly(d, log(n)) and space O(log(n)), the communication complexity is poly(d, log(n)), and the prover runs in time poly(n). In particular, for languages computable by log-space uniform NC (circuits of polylog(n) depth), the prover is efficient, the verifier runs in time n · polylog(n) and space O(log(n)), and the communication complexity is polylog(n). Using this theorem we make progress on several questions.\n --- We show how to construct 1-round computationally sound arguments with polylog communication for any log-space uniform NC computation. The verifier runs in quasi-linear time. This result uses a recent transformation of Kalai and Raz from public coin interactive proofs to 1-round arguments. The soundness of the argument system is based on the existence of a PIR scheme with polylog communication.\n --- We construct interactive proofs with public coin, log-space, poly-time verifiers for all of P are given. This settles an open question regarding the expressive power of proof systems with such verifiers.\n --- We construct zero-knowledge interactive proofs are given with communication complexity quasi-linear in the witness length for any NP language verifiable in NC, based on the existence of 1-way functions.\n --- We construct probabilistically checkable arguments (a model due to Kalai and Raz) of size polynomial in the witness length (rather than instance length) for any NP language verifiable in NC, under computational assumptions, are provided.",

      "abstract": "Smart contracts are programs that execute autonomously on blockchains. Their key envisioned uses (e.g. financial instruments) require them to consume data from outside the blockchain (e.g. stock quotes). Trustworthy data feeds that support a broad range of data requests will thus be critical to smart contract ecosystems.\n We present an authenticated data feed system called Town Crier (TC). TC acts as a bridge between smart contracts and existing web sites, which are already commonly trusted for non-blockchain applications. It combines a blockchain front end with a trusted hardware back end to scrape HTTPS-enabled websites and serve source-authenticated data to relying smart contracts.\n TC also supports confidentiality. It enables private data requests with encrypted parameters. Additionally, in a generalization that executes smart-contract logic within TC, the system permits secure use of user credentials to scrape access-controlled online data sources.\n We describe TC's design principles and architecture and report on an implementation that uses Intel's recently introduced Software Guard Extensions (SGX) to furnish data to the Ethereum smart contract system. We formally model TC and define and prove its basic security properties in the Universal Composibility (UC) framework. Our results include definitions and techniques of general interest relating to resource consumption (Ethereum's \"gas\" fee system) and TCB minimization. We also report on experiments with three example applications.\n We plan to launch TC soon as an online public service.",

      "abstract": "Cryptocurrencies record transactions in a decentralized data structure called a blockchain. Two of the most popular cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum, support the feature to encode rules or scripts for processing transactions. This feature has evolved to give practical shape to the ideas of smart contracts, or full-fledged programs that are run on blockchains. Recently, Ethereum's smart contract system has seen steady adoption, supporting tens of thousands of contracts, holding millions dollars worth of virtual coins.\n In this paper, we investigate the security of running smart contracts based on Ethereum in an open distributed network like those of cryptocurrencies. We introduce several new security problems in which an adversary can manipulate smart contract execution to gain profit. These bugs suggest subtle gaps in the understanding of the distributed semantics of the underlying platform. As a refinement, we propose ways to enhance the operational semantics of Ethereum to make contracts less vulnerable. For developers writing contracts for the existing Ethereum system, we build a symbolic execution tool called Oyente to find potential security bugs. Among 19, 336 existing Ethereum contracts, Oyente flags 8, 833 of them as vulnerable, including the TheDAO bug which led to a 60 million US dollar loss in June 2016. We also discuss the severity of other attacks for several case studies which have source code available and confirm the attacks (which target only our accounts) in the main Ethereum network.",

Although the conventional wisdom is to build atop a (weakly) synchronous protocol such as PBFT (or a variation thereof), such protocols rely critically on network timing assumptions, and only guarantee liveness when the network behaves as expected. We argue these protocols are ill-suited for this deployment scenario. We present an alternative, HoneyBadgerBFT, the first practical asynchronous BFT protocol, which guarantees liveness without making any timing assumptions. We base our solution on a novel atomic broadcast protocol that achieves optimal asymptotic efficiency. We present an implementation and experimental results to show our system can achieve throughput of tens of thousands of transactions per second, and scales to over a hundred nodes on a wide area network. We even conduct BFT experiments over Tor, without needing to tune any parameters. Unlike the alternatives, HoneyBadgerBFT simply does not care about the underlying network.",

      "abstract": "Lattice-based cryptography offers some of the most attractive primitives believed to be resistant to quantum computers. Following increasing interest from both companies and government agencies in building quantum computers, a number of works have proposed instantiations of practical post-quantum key exchange protocols based on hard problems in ideal lattices, mainly based on the Ring Learning With Errors (R-LWE) problem. While ideal lattices facilitate major efficiency and storage benefits over their non-ideal counterparts, the additional ring structure that enables these advantages also raises concerns about the assumed difficulty of the underlying problems. Thus, a question of significant interest to cryptographers, and especially to those currently placing bets on primitives that will withstand quantum adversaries, is how much of an advantage the additional ring structure actually gives in practice. Despite conventional wisdom that generic lattices might be too slow and unwieldy, we demonstrate that LWE-based key exchange is quite practical: our constant time implementation requires around 1.3ms computation time for each party; compared to the recent NewHope R-LWE scheme, communication sizes increase by a factor of 4.7x, but remain under 12 KiB in each direction. Our protocol is competitive when used for serving web pages over TLS; when partnered with ECDSA signatures, latencies increase by less than a factor of 1.6x, and (even under heavy load) server throughput only decreases by factors of 1.5x and 1.2x when serving typical 1 KiB and 100 KiB pages, respectively. To achieve these practical results, our protocol takes advantage of several innovations. These include techniques to optimize communication bandwidth, dynamic generation of public parameters (which also offers additional security against backdoors), carefully chosen error distributions, and tight security parameters.",

Our protocols fall in the two-server model where data owners distribute their private data among two non-colluding servers who train various models on the joint data using secure two-party computation (2PC). We develop new techniques to support secure arithmetic operations on shared decimal numbers, and propose MPC-friendly alternatives to non-linear functions such as sigmoid and softmax that are superior to prior work. We implement our system in C++. Our experiments validate that our protocols are several orders of magnitude faster than the state of the art implementations for privacy preserving linear and logistic regressions, and scale to millions of data samples with thousands of features.

Algorand ensures that users never have divergent views of confirmed transactions, even if some of the users are malicious and the network is temporarily partitioned. In contrast, existing cryptocurrencies allow for temporary forks and therefore require a long time, on the order of an hour, to confirm transactions with high confidence.\n Algorand uses a new Byzantine Agreement (BA) protocol to reach consensus among users on the next set of transactions. To scale the consensus to many users, Algorand uses a novel mechanism based on Verifiable Random Functions that allows users to privately check whether they are selected to participate in the BA to agree on the next set of transactions, and to include a proof of their selection in their network messages. In Algorand's BA protocol, users do not keep any private state except for their private keys, which allows Algorand to replace participants immediately after they send a message. This mitigates targeted attacks on chosen participants after their identity is revealed.\n We implement Algorand and evaluate its performance on 1,000 EC2 virtual machines, simulating up to 500,000 users. Experimental results show that Algorand confirms transactions in under a minute, achieves 125x Bitcoin's throughput, and incurs almost no penalty for scaling to more users.",
